NeverFap Deluxe Summary


## 01


Here's a basic summary of NeverFap Deluxe!

For a much more in-depth overview of NeverFap Deluxe there really is no substitute to reading the NeverFap Deluxe Homepage. It's written a bit like a visual novel too, so it's significantly more engaging!

With that said, this summary is also pretty neat, and I know a lot of people appreciate it as a refresher to all the basic concepts of NeverFap Deluxe.

Otherwise, you may also benefit from the 7 Day NeverFap Deluxe Kickstarter which covers a lot of the high-level concepts of NeverFap Deluxe in a very broad way.



## 02



Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Summary.

If I had to fundamentally describe what we're trying to achieve here with NeverFap Deluxe, one particular word comes to mind.

Balance.

In fact, everything on this website is designed to help you achieve balance in some way, and for good reason.


#### Balance makes overcoming your porn addiction trivial." 


When you have balance you no longer experience urges, you no longer doubt yourself and most of all, you gain the power and freedom to live your life however you want.

I don't care about your moral arguments. I don't even really care whether you think porn is good or bad or not. 

The only thing I care about is process, because I'm a master of process and that's why you're here on my website.

So the process I'm about to share with you is designed to help you achieve balance in life, which will help you regain control over your mind so you can easily overcome your porn addiction.

Now in order to achieve this balance, porn addiction recovery actually comes down to one very simple idea.


#### Replacing Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms with Healthy Coping Mechanisms." 


Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms include things like watching porn and being judgemental/self-critical, while Healthy Coping Mechanisms include things like remaining calm and practicing meditation.

There is no alternative to this process.

There are no "cheap hacks" to suddenly make you stop being addicted to porn, where you suddenly have this "moment of awareness" where all your bad habits dissolve away and your life returns to normal.

Instead, it is a hard process of learning to replace negative habits with positive ones, and that's really all there is to it. 

Now, the reason why you've most likely been struggling to overcome your porn addiction for so long, is because chances are you've been going about this process in an unproductive way. 

For example, you may have been attempting to distract yourself via youtube videos, cold showers, exercise etc. as a way to address your uncomfortable feelings, urges and emotions.


#### When instead you should have been learning to consciously engage and be present with your feelings and emotions." 


What a lot of people don't realise is that distraction is in fact one of the many Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms we practice on a daily basis which actually sabotages our ability to remain present with ourselves.

And this is why education and awareness play such an important part of the porn addiction recovery process, so we can truly understand the effect our behaviours and actions have on the outcomes we experience on a daily basis.

In fact, you may never have attempted to replace those Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms in any meaningful or healthy way.

In a way that has empowered you to approach your emotions and feelings without fear, prejudice, irrationality or anxiety. 

Instead, hoping those aspects of your personality would somehow wither away on their own, which unfortunately is one of the primary reasons why people remain addicted to porn for so long.

Only by consciously addressing our mental health in a meaningful way can we hope to achieve positive change in our habits and behaviours.

Now, the reason why Healthy Coping Mechanisms work is quite simple.


#### Healthy Coping Mechanisms work because they help you develop control over your mind." 


Control which allows you to dictate every single aspect of how you think, feel and behave, as you have been designed to do as a modern human being.

To come back to our previous example, distraction is an Unhealthy Coping Mechanism because it doesn't help us develop control over our minds. 

Instead, it does the exact opposite of that. Distraction merely puts our emotions and feelings aside, without truly addressing them in a conscious, nor meaningful way.

Furthermore, I would like to add that learning to develop control over our minds is a completely reasonable goal which everyone is capable of.

Certainly, from the perspective of your porn addiction, it can help to think of your self-destructive behaviours and Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms as a learning difficulty. 

Which is to say that there's nothing inherently wrong with you. 

You simply haven't been taught how to think and feel in constructive way that has made sense to you, possibly for a very long time since childhood.

Well, Healthy Coping Mechanisms are going to be the sole means through which we will learn to develop that control, arguably because there are no other sustainable alternatives. 

For example, you'd be hard pressed to convince me that binging on junk food or expressing constant anger is ever going to be a sustainable method towards dealing with your emotions.

As opposed to something like meditation which doesn't affect your physical health negatively, and which only has a positive net-benefit mentally.

So what does it mean to have developed control over your mind?


#### Essentially, it means being able to consciously direct your mind however you like 100% of the time." 


Rather than have your subconscious behaviours, habits and desires dictate your outcomes in life.

And this really is key to understanding why you may have been struggling with your porn addiction for so long.

Many Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms are merely learnt behaviours and responses which can be tracked back to childhood.

Picked up (and possibly even taught) from family and friends, simply because no one knew any better. 

Well, the good news is that just as those behaviours have been developed, they can also be replaced and relearnt with Healthy Coping Mechanisms instead, especially now that you're conscious of them.

Now there are three broad categories of Healthy Coping Mechanism which contribute towards achieving balance in life.

Awareness, Calmness and Ambition.

If you have all three of these areas in your life under control then you will be in balance and you won't struggle with urges, doubt or any potential self-limiting beliefs you may have.

Most people however struggle with at least one or two of these categories, and those areas will be your key focus during your recovery.

In addition, the only way to develop these Healthy Coping Mechanisms is through practice and consistency. Which is to say that they are the only two things which matter to your recovery from a process point of view.

And of course, the easiest way to develop both Calmness and Awareness is through meditation.

For most people, this essentially comes down to 10 minutes of meditation each day, and this will be enough for most people to help them develop control over their minds.

It's personally what I do everyday, and it's what helps me maintain balance. 

Of course, you may struggle primarily with Ambition as well. I don't know you well enough to say for certain, although I'm happy to provide you with personalised advice via our #NewNeverFapper initiative.

...aaaaand that is NeverFap Deluxe in a nutshell.


## About NeverFap Deluxe


There is a world out there, you know.


## 01


Welcome to NeverFap Deluxe!

I decided to create this website in 2019 to help people overcome porn addiction, in the easiest and most effective way possible.

In essence, I aim to teach people how to be in complete control of their minds using the power of meditation and other various awareness and mental health practices.

Not only have I personally overcome my own porn addiction using these impressive skills and abilities (to a point that I literally do not think about porn, nor struggle with it in any capacity).

However I want to help you do the same too.




## 02


While everyone is aware of the NoFap movement, no one actually seems to be able to effectively explain how to achieve NoFap with any sort of coherence or consistency.

Most of the materials I could find online ranged from various theories on how to manage porn cravings and emotions using ineffective and unhealthy coping mechanisms.

To personal advice from existing porn addicts who's opinion seemed to change depending on the day of the week, as per their unpredictable schedule of relapse and mania.

I mean, you wouldn't trust financial advice from someone with a gambling problem, so why should you treat your porn addiction recovery any differently?


#### That's when I knew there was an opportunity to create a website that could save people years attempting to overcome their porn addiction." 


Introducing NeverFap Deluxe.

A comprehensive online step-by-step how-to guide which explains exactly what you need to do to overcome porn addiction.

Based upon the healthy coping mechanisms I've developed over the years, which I use on a daily basis to help keep my mind calm, balanced and under control.

No more excuses. No more compromises.

This is the real deal.






## 03


In order to teach you to adapt to these healthy coping mechanisms, NeverFap Deluxe maintains one goal.



#### Ultimately, I believe the process of overcoming porn addiction should be deceptively simple." 


With the right information and guidance, I believe overcoming porn addiction can be an incredibly straight-forward process that anyone can partake at any point in their life.

A process which doesn't discriminate against how smart you are, against how much knowledge you already have about your porn addiction, nor concern who you are today. 

I have put a lot of effort into ensuring that the information on this website is fun, engaging and accessible so that it becomes as clear as daylight as to why this process works, as well as how you can comfortably commit to it without hesitation.

This means reading the articles and guides on this website until it becomes second-nature to you, as well as committing to your daily routine of meditation and awareness practice.

It is the very reason why NeverFap Deluxe is so effective at helping you overcome porn addiction.

Because it just makes sense.

# Introduction


Coming to the realisation that you're a porn addict, as well as making the decision to overcome your porn addiction is arguably one of the most profound things you will ever do.

It will completely change the way you feel, think and perceive yourself and others.


#### But only if you're willing to trust the process." 


What does this mean?

It means challenging yourself with new ideas you may outright disagree with, and which may not make any sense to you at all for a period of time, inspite of the effort you spend practicing them.

It means rejecting and ignoring your human instincts, as well as accepting that everything you know about yourself is not only incorrect, but the primary reason why you're addicted to porn.

It means committing to your daily routine of meditation, even when your mind is convinced that it's unnecessary because you've managed to remain mentally stable for a couple of weeks.

It means acknowledging how truly dire and self-destructive your current habit is, as a very serious form of self-harm which you have normalised as a viable solution to your problems.

For a literal number of years up until now.


#### In essence, it means distrusting yourself." 


Because up until now, you've put so much trust and faith into lying to yourself and supporting your addiction, that you're no longer able to identify what's truly wrong with you.

Which is to say that you're in denial.


You're in denial because you continue to masturbate to porn inspite of how much you hate it, inspite of how rotten it makes you feel, as well as how much it is destroying you in almost every single way.

It takes a considerable level of denial to allow oneself to self-harm to this extent, and it is an incredibly serious condition no different to having a severe mental illness.

Acknowledging that you're in denial is the first step towards initiating positive change.

Because although we may have good intentions at heart, when we fail to recognise that we're in denial, we can only continue to repeat and strengthen these self-destructive behaviours, time and time again.

Denial which causes us to distrust our recovery processes, because we fail to recognise how truly harmful these behaviours are.

The same kind of denial that pedophiles and murderers use to justify their actions, because they feel comfortable with their own reasoning and logic, regardless of the consequences.

Just as you have until now.


#### This is why it takes up to 5 years on average for people to overcome their porn addiction." 


Because they remain in denial about their problems, without truly realising the extent to which they maintain this facade.

Well, I'm here to break the cycle.

Understand that the sole reason why people relapse and lose control of themselves, is because of a decision they've made at some point to distrust the process.

Perhaps they thought they'd be fine skipping out on their routine meditation for a couple of days, because they were comfortable with the level of mental health they'd achieved up until then.

Perhaps they failed to maintain their awareness because they thought it would be okay to act with excessive judgement in a particular situation, because "that's just what everyone does".

Perhaps they decided to continuing working past their designated nightly cut-off time because they decided in this one particular instance, that it was okay to put their work before their mental health.

All behaviours which outright neglect the sanctity of our commitment to the addiction recovery process.

Behaviours which inevitably lead to compromised positions where we find ourselves no longer able to control our thoughts and emotions, because our minds have lost balance.

Behaviours which leave us truly terrified, when we realise that we've left ourselves with nothing more than our hesitation in order to deal with our difficult feelings and emotions.

Behaviours which almost always result in relapse and an all-too-familiar sense of dread and disappointment.

You distrust the process. You lose the game.

It's that simple.


#### On the other hand, if you commit to the steps you are 100% guaranteed to succeed." 


There is absolutely no doubt about it.

No different to hitting the gym everyday, if you work out consistently you will put on muscle and you will become strong.

You can ignore it. You can fear it. You can tell yourself it's not worth it, or that it won't work for you. You can even claim that weakness is a superior attribute, and that exercise is a form of self-harm.

It really doesn't matter what you think. In no way does your opinion change the fact that consistently lifting heavy weights in the gym will improve your strength.

Your mental health is no different.

If you practice meditation everyday and work on your awareness, you are guaranteed to become more in control of your thoughts, feelings and emotions over time.

The process doesn't lie.

I mean, it's just a process after all.

A series of steps which have been designed to help you improve as you take them one step at a time. It really doesn't get anymore simple than this. Trust the process and you will succeed.

Of course, I'm not expecting you to trust the process immediately.

People will tend to distrust the process a few times, also known as the process of trial and error. But that's really up to you and how you choose to reason with your own denial.


#### Most commonly, the reason why people end up distrusting the process is because they eventually believe that they're somehow above it." 


For example, they may reach a point of being so mentally stable for so long, that they assume that they can just go back to old habits without being affected by it, as if they've become permanently cured.

This is not how processes work.

For example, you can't just eat once and be done with it. You need to eat every single day in order to sustain yourself, and your mental health should be treated no differently.

You need to be practicing meditation and other awareness exercises every single day, not because you're inherently messed up, but because it's a normal, healthy thing to do.

Of course, if you're not already dedicating time towards any amount of self-maintenance, then even the slightest commitment may seem excessive for some people.

When facing these kinds of dilemas, it can help to remember that you're in denial, and that what you're feeling is always unreasonable and needs to be challenged.

I know when I started out, I found it immensely difficult to convince myself to find even 5 minutes to dedicate towards meditation, because I viewed it as a huge waste of time, if not a burden to my schedule.

Yep, I was a tough nut to crack.

Certainly, you'll have the opportunity to come to the same realisations that I did throughout my journey, given I'll be teaching you the same healthy coping mechanisms that I've also adopted.

Which is a key thing to note, because as a collective we're all ultimately going to experience the same emotions and feelings of recovery.

The same initial feelings of doubt. The same overwhelming feelings of elation once we discover the power of meditation. The same feelings of empowerment once we gain full control over our emotions.

The same end result of being happy, confident and entirely porn free without even a hint of hesitation.

Not because I believe in your inherent ability to succeed.

But because I understand the incredible power of process as a driving force for permanent change, regardless of who you are or where you've come from.

The process is your best friend.

# Getting Started


If you haven't yet had the chance, I highly recommend that you check out the NeverFap Deluxe Homepage.

It explores in great detail what you can expect from NeverFap Deluxe, as well as serve as a fantastic introduction into some of the skills you'll be learning from the materials on this website.

Following on from the homepage, there are essentially two core skills we must learn.


{{< hrg "The first skill is <u>awareness</u>" 


Awareness relates to your ability to remain conscious.

In other words, your ability to navigate your mind in order to pursue healthy coping mechanisms. Ultimately, it is what will allow you to assert control over yourself.

In fact, your awareness is the reason why you're reading this paragraph, because at some point you made the conscious decision to do something about your porn addiction.

Of course, just because your mind is conscious, doesn't mean that you've developed the ability to think consciously all the time, let alone when your emotions have gotten the better of you.

No different to hitting the gym, only by practicing awareness can we learn to snap into consciousness at the worst of times, and therefore pursue healthy coping mechanisms without difficulty.

Awareness is your ticket out of this mess. It is your capacity for conscious action and your core mechanism for maintaining civil accountablity over your actions.

It will be key to your success.


{{< hrg "The second skill is <u>calmness</u>." 


Calmness is your ability to remain relaxed.

It is an important ability to have because in 99% of situations it will be your go-to healthy coping mechanism for dealing with mentally challenging situations.

In fact, it will be your go-to.

Period.

You should always aim to remain calm and calculated, as that will allow you to be at your absolute most effective. Primarily, because we are at our most conscious when our mind is calm.

Which is to say that our ability to exert control over ourselves is at our highest when we are calm, which makes dealing with cravings and other potentially disruptive feelings an absolute piece of cake.

Calmness is what makes things easy.

You want this to be easy, right?


{{< hrg "<u>Meditation</u> is how we will be developing these skills." 


Why meditation?

Because meditation teaches us both awareness and calmness at the same time, which is precisely why it's so powerful in terms of teaching us to adopt healthy coping mechanisms.

Furthermore, it's an incredibly simple process, which is vital when we already have limited conscious awareness to begin with.

Honestly, all it takes is 10 minutes of meditation per day in order to develop sufficient control over your awareness and calmness.

It's one of the easiest and most impactful investments you can ever make towards your mental health.

It will change your life.




{{< hrg "Well actually, there is a third skill <u>Ambition</u>." 


Ambition is everything else once you've mastered awareness and calmness.

Ambition is more a social expectation in terms of helping you thrive in society, rather than an actual requirement in terms of assisting you in maintaining your happiness and well-being.

Something which is designed to enhance your life, but still remain secondary to awareness and calmness.

It's part of the reason why I don't place a heavy focus on ambition, nor give it much attention.

In general because it's something that will come naturally to you once you master your awareness and calmness, so you've got that to look forward to as well.

It's simply the cherry on top of the cake.

Not the cake itself.

### Train your capacity for awareness by keeping track of your mental health progress.


The first thing we are going to do is put in place a system of accountability that is designed to not only get us excited, but also help us keep on top of the healthy coping mechanisms we practice everyday.

In order to do this, we will be posting a daily journal into the NeverFap Deluxe Discord ">#accountability channel.

Can't be bothered?

Well, that's the reason why it takes 5 years on average of people to overcome their porn addiction. You distrust the process, you lose the game. It's honestly that simple.

Furthermore, it's a great opportunity to see what everyone else is doing in terms of their healthy coping mechanisms, as well as understand the steps they're taking on a daily basis to get 90+ days with their progress.

Another great thing about ">#accountability is the tight-nit community we have on the channel. Because we're small, you get the care and attention you deserve and I always respond to messages within 24 hours.

Oh, and let's not forget the acknowledgement process! We acknowledge each other's journal entries with with emojis, and it's a great motivator to see that other people are following the same journey that you are.

For a set of useful guidelines on the NeverFap Deluxe Accountability Program, please check this web page.



## 06


### Learn more about the inner workings of porn addiction recovery and the power of mental health.

NeverFap Deluxe Articles are designed to provide you with a better understanding behind the how and why of porn addiction recovery.

They are fantastic resources which provide in-depth analysis of issues related to porn addiction recovery, and are referenced throughout the website.

Here are some of my top picks.



## 08


### Learn more about porn addiction recovery in audio form!

The NeverFap Deluxe Podcast is a fornightly podcast about porn addiction recovery. It aims to be informative, silly and somewhat hopelessly chic.

I wanted to have some fun with this one, it's a bit rediculous at times, but I'd also think to think that's equally as informative as it is oddly sensual.

The podcast is primarily available on Castbox and Spotify.

<iframe src="https://castbox.fm/app/castbox/player/id2045024?v=4.1.0&autoplay=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="300"></iframe>



## 07


### Develop a greater understanding of awareness and meditation best practices.


NeverFap Deluxe Practices focus solely on verifiable steps you can do on a daily basis to help you build awareness and calmness.

At a bare minimum you should be meditating everyday, usually for 10 minutes before bed (at least that's what most people find easiest, myself included).

To be quite honest, 100% of the actual recovery process in terms of effective change is nothing more than meditation.

However, because humans are silly and will refuse to commit (not to mention, we do silly things like get addicted to porn), I've dedicated a good 85% of this website towards convincing you why you should commit.

With the other 15% actually focused on meditation exercises and practices.

That's because convincing you to actually treat your mental health seriously is 85% of the battle. It's the primary thing most people struggle with, otherwise you wouldn't have become a porn addict within the first place.

Regardless, here are some exercises that I recommend.



## 05


### Learn more about the NeverFap Deluxe Method within a seven day period.


Well, well, well.

The 7 Day NeverFap Deluxe Kickstarter is an email campaign I've put together which aims to teach you a little bit more about the inner workings of NeverFap Deluxe, as well as recommend you various NeverFap Articles and Practices.

It covers a range of core topics which are vital for helping you overcome your porn addiction, delivered straight to your email address each day over the course of a week.

We also feature a range of other useful guides and courses which become available if you sign up for a FREE NeverFap Deluxe Account.

If you'd like to learn more about the 7 Day NeverFap Deluxe Kickstarter, I've put together this fancy landing page which explores in greater detail what you will learn.

It is highly recommended for newcomers to NeverFap Deluxe or those who would simply like more information on how best to approach their porn addiction.



# The Importance Of Meditation For Porn Addiction
 2018-12-12




Meditation is the single most important thing you can do for your porn addiction.


#### In fact, ten minutes of meditation each day is probably enough for most porn addicts to overcome their addiction." 


No, seriously. 

It really is that simple. 

Of course, the reason why this doesn't happen is because most porn addicts are completely oblivious as to the benefits of meditation. 

Not to mention, most porn addicts have a hard time sticking to a routine of meditation, which is entirely necessary in order for it to be successful.

Which is why the other 99% of this website exists, to help you understand why it's absolutely vital.


#### Why meditation?" 


Without diving too deep into the intricate details of how to meditate, nor necessarily what meditation actually is, let's start off by talking about what meditation effectively achieves. 

In essence, meditation is the most powerful way for you to regain power over your emotions.

Not just your emotions, but your thoughts, feelings and everything else associated with the inherent functioning of your brain.

Here's the deal, being a porn addict has changed the way your brain works. 

It's no longer stable.

It's no longer doing exactly what you want it to.


#### What meditation allows you to do is develop the ability to maintain control over your mind." 


So you no longer feel compelled to watch porn.

Of course, porn may not even be the reason why you lack the ability to control your mind. 

It may be that you never developed those healthy coping mechanisms growing up, and that it was inevitable you were going to be become addicted to porn or engage in other self-harming behaviour as a result.

Certainly, this is the category that most people fit into.


#### Meditation and Porn addiction" 


Overcoming porn addiction is actually a relatively straight-forward process.

It largely comes down to developing control over your emotions, as well as developing an understanding of how your mind works.

In terms of developing control over your emotions, it means practicing meditation on a daily basis so that you can remain calm and collected irrespective of what may be happening external to your mind.

In terms of understanding your own emotions, it's about having the capacity to not take your own emotions personally, and to remain calm when you feel as if your emotions are out of your control.


#### If you can manage those two things, you'll more-or-less be 90% of the way there to overcoming your porn addiction." 


Yet most people struggle.

Precisely because they don't do those things.

They don't meditate on a frequent basis. They don't understand their emotions. 

They don't know how to maintain control over their minds, and yet they wonder why they struggle.

This is precisely the reason why meditation is important, because it provides us with the ability to face these challenges without hesitation or fear.


#### When you have control over your emotions, it makes situations where you don't necessarily feel in control manageable." 


Yes. 

Manageable.

Because successfully overcoming porn addiction is largely about learning to navigate through your emotions, and manage them so that you can be in control of your desired outcomes.

And you can't manage your emotions if you don't have mastery over your mind, along with your ability to produce and regulate them.

So what exactly are some of the skills and practices of meditation? 

For starters, there's observation. 


#### Observation is perhaps the most fundamental skill you can learn in regards to developing your awareness." 


It is the skill we will focus on and develop most throughout the practices here on NeverFap Deluxe.



In part, because it's really hard to take something personally or lose our frame of reference when we're merely observing reality.

As opposed to being invested in it with our own personal beliefs, thoughts and judgements

Aside from observation, there is also introspection (our ability to look into ourselves), perspective (changing the way we think about things), as well as a whole range of different skills.

These skills are broken into Five Fundamental Principles which allow us to focus on particular outcomes related to overcoming porn addiction.

I recommend checking out our list of NeverFap Deluxe Practices for a list of exercises you can do to develop awareness in your life.


# Paying The NeverFap Maintenance Tax
 2018-12-02




What exactly is the NeverFap Maintenance Tax?

Well, aside from the fact that it's a term I've more-or-less made up on the spot, the NeverFap Maintenance Tax refers to the time and effort required in order to maintain our physical and mental health. 

It includes things like meditation, exercising, relaxing, studying, meditating, eating and brushing our teeth. 

Everything that helps us keep regular. 

The reason why I call it a tax is because many of us have the attitude that maintaining these things is simply unnecessary.

In fact, most of us can tend to view these things as a burden (usually due to the amount of time associated with actually doing them), despite the positive benefits they provide.

So what ends ups happening is that become selective about what we view as necessary or not. 

Maybe we don’t exercise, because we’d rather be studying or playing video games. Maybe we work or study too hard, because we don’t see the value in meditating or relaxing.


#### In doing this, we make significant compromises to our ability to function." 


And what’s really disturbing, is how utterly unaware we are of how much we compromise in terms of our ability to function, often without truly being aware of it.

Certainly, I’ve been there.

And only now in retrospect do I realise how I was making something like giving up porn addiction almost impossible due to my own negative attitudes towards self-care.


#### In other words, if you’re struggling with your porn addiction it may be because you’re not paying your maintenance tax in full." 


In order to demonstrate this, I’m first going to talk about where I personally was making those compromises in my life.

And then explain the effect it was having on my ability to cope. 

As well as what successfully paying the maintenance tax actually entails.


#### Facing the consequences of imbalance" 


Prior to this realisation, I was under the impression that I was relatively functional and healthy. 

I was exercising three times a week. I was eating healthily. I was in a fantastic relationship. I was incredibly passionate about studying and I was full of ambition, ready to take on the world. 

On the other hand, there were other aspects of my life that were severely imbalanced. 

Aside from being severely addicted to porn, I was beginning to suffer from anxiety attacks from my excessive studying.

I was studying so much that it used to induce these kinds of 'coding nightmares' where I would be mentally coding in my sleep, but stuck in an indefinite loop where I would just write the same code again and again and again. 

It was truly awful.

My problem was that I was pushing myself too hard and I didn’t provide myself with the opportunity to relax.

All because I didn't view relaxation as a form of maintenance, in part because I was so obsessed with being productive and not falling behind.

Once I'd respected this balance however (primarily by not overworking myself to death) I was able function more clearly.

And most importantly, regain control over my emotions so that my cravings for porn could become a thing of the past.

Of course, you may have an opposite problem. You may not be motivated enough.

Everyone is different in this regard, and this website is designed to help you figure out exactly where your weaknesses are.


#### Change in attitude" 


Embracing self-care requires a change in attitude. 

Instead of thinking about our immediate wants, we need to begin thinking holistically and understand that cutting corners of any kind is going to result in future pain. 

Certainly, costing us time and emotional stability in the long run. 

Which exponentially increases the difficulty of everything else we hope to achieve, regardless of how much time we spend on those pursuits themselves.

Only by paying the maintanence tax can we ensure a) Our mental health remains intact and b) We achieve all our ambitions equally.

And that really is the key point people completely miss:

#### By respecting balance in our life, we can have everything we want without the compromise." 

It simply requires respecting long-term outcomes, as opposed to hesitant, short-term outcomes.

The key takeaway from this article is that self-care exists above all, especially if you care about productivity.

Furthermore, that self-care is not optional. 

It is a hard requirement and by avoiding self-care, we delay so many positive aspects of our life. 




# You Always Have Time For Your Mental Health
 2019-01-21




There's one excuse that I often see porn addicts come up with in regards to their addiction.


#### I don't have enough time." 


Usually, it means time to spend towards addressing their porn addiction or mental health issues.

After all, we're all incredibly busy people. We have things to do. Ambitions to fulfil. I mean, what does any of this have to do with porn addiction?

It's an attitude which quite ironically, prevents us from actually focusing on what's important in life.

Which is why we're talking about it today.


#### Because if you did have enough time to spend towards addressing your porn addiction, you simply wouldn't be a porn addict." 


So what exactly does it mean to not have enough time?

Well, that's entirely up to you.

Maybe it's because you feel compelled to always be in a state of constant "productivity", and that time spent working on your mental health doesn't seem productive.

Or perhaps, it's merely the feeling of productivity you crave.

For example, checking your phone every five minutes to see if someone's messaged you over Facebook.

On the otherhand, you may just be so obsessed with your goals and ambitions, that everything else which sits outside of those goals is seen as being irrelevant.

Regardless of your interpretation, I'm here to tell you that thinking that you do not have enough time for your mental health is a disorder.

That is correct.


#### If you believe that you do not have enough time for your mental health then you have a mental disorder." 


It's a mental disorder because it's a choice to willingly neglect one's mental health, due to habit and desire.

And there are never any valid reasons why anyone should ever neglect their own mental health.

It's the most important thing you have, and it's incredibly difficult not to suffer when you don't have your mental health in order.

The moment you compromise on your mental health is when you introduce the potential to suffer.

Although perhaps you'd rather suffer just to satisfy that feeling of productivity or get that extra bit further with your ambitions.


#### Again, ask yourself how this mentality isn't a sign of having a disorder." 


Part of this disorder consists of valuing time over quality of life.

So a question worth asking is:

<u><b>What is time without your mental health?</b></u>


Without mental health, time becomes an uncontrollable struggle of judgement, self-criticism and depression.

Instead of having control over what we think and feel, we instead find ourselves taking everything personally and feeling helpless to absolutely everything in our life.

Without our mental health, days may seem like years in situations we largely find unbearable, which has the possibility to become any situation because that is no longer for us to decide.

Without our mental health, life becomes very difficult.


#### Of course, there's a reason why poor mental health is often described as a self-repeating cycle." 


We choose to obsess over something which we believe will make us happy i.e. addiction, uncheked ambitions etc.

We worship that activity with our effort and time, believing it will make us feel better about ourselves.

We end up feeling empty once the obsession wears off, inspite of all the time we spent believing in these solutions.

Then we go and repeat the cycle again and again and again.


#### And to be honest, it's a bit shit." 


I'm sure you think so too.

All because we don't believe we have enough time to actually commit to something which will know will improve our frame of mind.

Although perhaps you don't really see the point to doing things which may or may not improve your mental well-being.

Certainly, I don't blame you.

It's hard to evaluate anything when your emotions are completely out of whack, and you genuinely believe that pursuing the same behaviours again and again will truly be "different this time" despite producing the exact same results of hope and depression in what seems to be a never ending cycle.


#### But let me say that there's never a bad time to commit to your mental health." 


One key thing to understand about mental health is that it's accumulative.

And the true beauty of mental health is that everything you've done up until now to negatively impact your mental health is completely irrelevant.

<u>**For the only thing which truly matters is that which you do today.**</u>

Ultimately, it's about focusing on what you can do today, and this is the key to breaking this habit of never committing to your mental health.

Realising that mental health isn't achieved by what you don't do, but rather by what you can do today.




#### Honestly, spending ten minutes at night before bed meditating is all most people need." 

Ultimately, however.

If you don't truly believe or understand why your mental health is more important than anything else in your life.

Then you're going to continue to pursue activities which will conflict with your mental health.

Just remember that whatever other things you achieve in place of your mental health, can never replace mental health itself.

Which is to say that your achievements outside of mental health will never serve as a true solution to your problems.

And when you do decide to work on your mental health, you may very well discover that everything you've pursued up until then has been utterly pointless.


#### From this point of view, you have nothing to gain from neglecting your mental health." 


No matter what other benefits those other achievements may provide.

Because in the overall scheme of things, your mental health is what determines how you feel, not your achievements.

So in the overall scheme of things, 10 minutes, or even an hour a day spent working on your mental health is miniscule, compared to the benefits it will provide in helping you better understand yourself.

Moving forward, I recommend checking out our list of NeverFap Deluxe Practices for a list of exercises you can do to develop awareness in your life.


# Everything Is A Choice
 2018-12-26





I want to talk about choice.

Specifically, how it relates to the Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap.

The first principle that I almost always introduce to people is <u>Choice over mind</u>, because it is the one principle that most porn addicts (usually) find the most profound. 


#### Choice over mind relates to this idea that we have full control over how we react in life." 


It's an important concept to understand, because once you fully embrace the power of choice in life, you can learn to overcome life's most difficult challenges.

Of course, assuming you put in the required practice.

In this article I want to help you better understand where you may be misunderstanding this idea of choice.

Because if you truly understood the power you currently have to change as an individual, you most likely wouldn't be on this website.

So let's consider this your formal re-education.


#### What is choice?" 


It begs to state that everything in life is a choice.

There's choice in how we feel. Choice in what we want to think. Choice in how we live, and what we want to eat. 

In fact, there's choice in almost everything that happens in life.

And yet, this doesn't mean that we necessarily get to choose all these things.

We don't get to choose our race. We don't get to choose how others live their lives. Hell, we certainly don't get to choose what the weather will be that day. 

And that's okay.


#### Because I'm here to tell you that none of this matters." 


Here's the thing.

You do have one choice which is so powerful that it effectively overrides every other choice in your life.

In part, because it is the only choice you truly have control over.


#### You get to choose how you want to respond." 


And it's a choice which overrides every other choice imaginable. 

Of course, I'm sure you're already aware of this fact. I mean, obviously you have the ability to react to life's circumstances.

Yet perhaps you don't quite understand the significance of what this actually means.

Perhaps you're misinterpretating what having this choice allows you to do, so let's explore that idea.

When you truly understand what <u>Choice over mind</u> means, it completely changes the way you look at things. 

You no longer become victim, or rather you realise that you never were victim, over that which you cannot choose.

So what does it being able to respond actually mean?


#### Put simply, your ability to respond is the most powerful choice you have, because it is the only choice you as an individual can actually make." 


At no point do you have absolute certainty over any outcome in life. 

Instead, what you do have is absolute certainty over your actions, and this is quite profound for a few reasons.

If your ability to respond is the only true choice that you have, then it signifies that you have full control over your life.

Because response happens through actions, and actions are the only means through which we can change as human beings. 


#### Which really is to say that you have full control over who you want to become." 


In addition, it also signifies that we are all equal in terms of our ability to take action.

Which is to say that we all have that exact same opportunity to become, because we all have the same ability to take action.

From this point of view, everything we are today can be viewed as a sum of our actions.

From a potential point of view, we really are no different.

We both have the exact same potential to respond on a low level with our thoughts and emotions.


#### The only difference between you and me is in the actions that we've taken over time." 
 

Which is to say that if you responded in the same way that I did, then you also would not be a porn addict.


#### Success and your actions" 


The important thing to understand about success is that it doesn't happen at a high level.

It happens on an emotional and physical level. 

Success is the difference between choosing to remain calm in a tense situation, as opposed to losing our cool. 

Success isn't about being wealthy or driving a fast car.

Success is about having control over our feelings and emotions, so we feel indifferent about how much money we or anyone else has.

In the context of porn addiction, success is acknowledging that our cravings for porn are merely habitual, and not to be taken personally. 

Success is meditating daily so that we can learn the skills to properly address our porn addiction.

Remember.


#### The only difference between someone who has successfully overcome porn addiction and someone who continually fails, is that the person who overcame porn addiction took the right actions to get there." 


Porn addicts really are no different from each other.

Every porn addict goes through the same feelings and emotions of helplessness, guilt and depression.

The only difference is in how they choose to respond to these feelings and emotions, so they don't let them dominate their life. 

Now, I'm not suggesting that you'll be able to face these feelings and emotions by merely being aware of them.


#### However, what I am suggesting is that with the right guidance and practice, you can develop the ability to be able to." 


Moving forward, I recommend checking out our list of NeverFap Deluxe Practices for a list of exercises you can do to develop awareness in your life.





# Introduction To The NeverFap Deluxe Guide
 2018-10-15




Today I’m here to talk to you about porn addiction.

Porn addiction itself can be a very complex topic. We can spend hours discussing the intricacies of how particular cultural upbringings affect the way we view women. 

We can bore over the details of our past trauma in order to extract why exactly we’re so obsessed with certain types of porn. 

We can do all sorts of things to try and understand why we humans are the way we are, and to be quite frank... it’s all very exhausting.

Because the truth is, overcoming pornography addiction is deceptively simple.

#### From a process point of view, I spend around 40 minutes each day practicing meditation." 

And that’s literally all I need to maintain control over my mind.

Of course, I also do a lot more, like train my mind with perspective exercises, but now that I'm in a stable state in regards to my porn addiction, all I really have do is maintain my mental health.

I now no longer think about porn. No longer do I crave porn. I wouldn’t even want to masturbate to porn if you put it in front of me.

It's just not how my mind works anymore.

And it's so empowering.

#### The point is that overcoming porn addiction is totally achievable." 

And I want to show you how.

Ultimately, we have one rule here at NeverFap: 

#### Practice. Practice. Practice." 

Without practicing the core skills that will help you overcome porn addiction, you simply cannot overcome porn addiction. I don't know how else to say it.

It's no different whether you want to become a successful body builder or a world class sculptor. Practice is the bridge that will help get you there.

You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it. 

So what's stopping you?

#### Cravings. Fear. Doubt. Anxiety. Addiction." 

Which is to say there's some kind of internal misunderstanding which is preventing you from doing what you want in your mind. 

Yes, a misunderstanding. 

Perhaps it's a self-limiting belief. Perhaps you haven't developed your awareness to a point that you can act with intention. Perhaps you have no idea what you're doing. 

Perhaps you've never developed a single healthy coping mechanism at all in your entire life. 

That's why I came up with The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap in order to help you better understand where you may be misunderstanding yourself.

#### Otherwise, known as denial." 

If we had to break down what people tend to find difficult in regards to overcoming their porn addiction. 

You could say that it comes down to a) Figuring out how to actually convince oneself to commit to porn recovery and b) Truly understanding what will work, and what will not.

This not only includes the knowledge surrounding porn recovery, but also working with our emotions to effectively apply it in everyday situations.

Which can be incredibly difficult, if not outright confusing when we don't truly have the confidence to know exactly what we're doing. 

We'll be feeling completely confident one week into our recovery, only to face what seems like an insurmountable wall of fear and doubt, which inevitably leads to relpase.

#### Well, that’s why I decided to create NeverFap Deluxe." 

My intention is to help you fill in all the gaps, so you don’t have to run around like a headless chook, the same way that I did for five years.

In this website, I hope to talk about every single aspect of how to successfully become porn free. What you’ll need to learn. How you can learn those things. How not to fall into certain traps.

How it's actually an incredibly straight-forward process if you just follow the motions.

I want to teach and explain all the core skills that I have come to learn over the past five years over My Personal Porn Recovery Journey, and I want to go into detail as to what these skills and understandings are.

As for a non-exhaustive list of these skills, here are some of the things which you will learn which will help you overcome porn addiction:

<hr class="hrul"/>

- Learn to focus on the how, not the why.
- Learn to value your mental health above all.
- Develop the ability to quiet and focus your mind.
- Learn to love and accept yourself and others unconditionally.
- Learn to invest in yourself.
- Change the way you think about sex and women.
- Value commitment and long-term thinking.
- Identify and understanding any potential mental disorders.
- Properly understand how to live life without porn.

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

I explore each of these aspects (and more) in detail, as well as why they are so crucial for in regards to successfully overcoming porn addiction.

#### Personally speaking it took me around 5 years of trial and error before everything finally clicked in my head." 

And I’m now at a point where porn has no control over me.

Realistically, you could probably achieve the same thing in around six months if you stuck to a rigorous routine.

However, I also maintain that humans simply aren’t like that. 

Some of us are driven by failure and by experiencing things the hard way. Others of us may be so deep in our delusion that it may take years to even realise that we have a problem. 

That’s okay too.

Understand that we’re not here to fight ourselves any longer. 

We’re here to understand who we are, what we have to do to change, as well as understand how we can improve as people.





# My Personal Porn Recovery Journey
 2018-10-22




I came across porn at a very young age. 

I started watching porn from the very moment I figured out how to physically masturbate at the age of 10.

And I'm sure your story is quite similar.

Discovering porn as a kid is like discovering Bitcoin as a young adult. 

It's this absurd hyper-fantasy that sucks you in and I really don't need to go into the details. I'm sure you're more than familiar with what it means to be someone who watches porn on a regular basis.

It sucks.

I'm not exactly sure when I decided that I wanted to give up porn, but I suppose there have been a variety of serious attempts through out my life.

My very first attempt at giving up porn began at age 16, where I thought I'd try to give up porn for the hell of it.

You know, because you're only ever 16 once, and I wanted to experience what 16 year old me could achieve.

Overall I managed to abstain for approximately 3 weeks, until collapsing into a puddle of sweat and binge-mania.

It then wasn't until I was around 20 years old that I began to recognise that porn was an actual problem in my life, if not from the simple perspective of being an addict. 

A problem which I was determined to understand and overcome. 


#### Age 25. October 20th 2018." 

The last time in my entire life that I will have ever masturbated to, or ever watched porn.

A commitment that I have upheld until today, rather effortlessly.

You know when you have that moment when everything clicks, and absolutely everything comes together and makes sense? 

I was the guy who had that moment, and I've been in control of myself ever since.

If I had to detail all the changes that occurred within that five year period, we'd literally be here all day.

Because, you know. 

A lot changes over the five year span of anyone's life, and the best we can do is look back in retrospect and identify the things that went right. 

So up until then, here's what I was doing right: 

<hr class="hrul"/>

- Done the whole Paleo diet thing
- Studied various books and perspective course on mental health
- Took cold showers everyday before bed
- Ate only one meal a day (via intermittent fasting)
- Was doing Leangains and lifting weights three times a week
- Was in an amazing, supportive relationship
- Worked obscenely hard to get a job as a programmer

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

Truth was, I was doing almost everything right.

Yet none of that actually mattered, because it was those small things that I wasn't doing, which made the other 90% of my effort null. 

Today I want to share what those things are with you are, and why they were arguably more important than anything I'd done up until then. 

I suppose there were two main things that happened, which helped me better understand exactly what I had to do to address my porn addiction. 

And it all happened within the space of a few weeks. 

#### For starters I had a breakdown." 


You see, I suffer from a condition from Bipolar Disorder, and it was something I hadn't told my partner about. 

In part, because I just assumed she already knew, but primarily because I'm not the kind of person who will ask for help from others. 

However, one day I was feeling particularly vulnerable and I realised one very important thing, which I maintain is important to this day:


#### It's impossible to do it alone." 


The reason why you break down is because for most people, it's almost impossible to admit that you have a problem, and so mentally you just turn to jelly. 

At first, she didn't take it seriously.

Because I'd never mentioned it once in our 4 year relationship. But when it kicked in that it was actually something I was hiding from her this whole time, it made a lot of sense. 

Ultimately, a few things happened as a result.

Now that she was aware of my disorder, I was now able to be honest about all the things I was hiding from her. In particular, my porn addiction which was in part a coping mechanism for my Bipolar.


#### Which as a result, gave me this surreal confidence to actually address my porn addiction." 


For whatever reason, when you get everything off your chest, it just completely changes everything.

You no longer feel guilt for who you are and you no longer see yourself as a monster. 

You merely see your actions as a symptom of something greater, which allows you to not take them personally, and not react to them negatively.

In addition, it also meant that I could ask for help and support when required. I could tell her that I was struggling with my porn addiction, and not feel judged or vindicated. 

Understanding and recognising my disorder, which I'd previously dismissed, helped me better understand my emotions and therefore, manage them a lot more easily. 

#### I finally felt free to just move on with my life." 

And it's impossible to understate what that feels like.

The second thing which happened, which came about in large part due to my breakdown and coming out about my Bipolar, was equally if not more profound in terms of addressing my porn addiction. 


#### Essentially, I'd discovered this thing called meditation." 


The funny thing about meditation is that I'd tried doing it through out various phases of my life to no avail.

Or perhaps all that effort had accumulated up until then, I'm not entirely sure.

Regardless, up until then I'd failed to see the value in the meditation. 

However following my break down, I'd decided to take my mental health seriously, and I was determined to do everything in my power to get better.

A friend at work had mentioned the benefits of meditation in his life, as well as a popular guided meditation course which he swore his life by. 

So I decided to do this course, which was basically a 10 minute commitment before bed each day, and my gosh. 


#### I can happily say that within two weeks of meditating I'd learnt more about how to manage my porn addiction than in absolutely everything I've done in the past five years to try and curb my addiction." 


All because of a simple 10 minute practice before bed. 

Absolutely incredible. 

The primary reason for this is because meditating allowed me to effectively control and manage my emotions

Primarily, the practice of meditation provided me with the ability to fully control my mind, something which I hadn't experienced before. 

It allowed me to relax my mind at will. To prevent incessant thinking and most importantly, not take my emotions and what I was feeling personally.


#### If I had one piece of advice to anyone wanting to seriously overcome their porn addiction, it would be to start meditating today." 


It is possibly the most essential thing you can do to assist you in overcoming porn addiction. 

Of course, what's also important is how you meditate, and that's precisely what I cover in this website.

For example, a form of meditation I personally find incredibly useful is walking in public, and simply avoiding placing our attention on people walking past us.

#### The next steps in my journey" 

Now that I've managed to successfully overcome porn addiction, I want to help you do the same.

Often the best way to learn something is to teach others how to do that same thing, and so that's what I want to do with NeverFap. 

To create a vibrant resource for other porn addicts to learn from, so we no longer have to struggle and cause harm in life due to the effects of addiction.

The information is all here.

Get started today.





# The Five Fundamental Principles Of NeverFap
 2018-10-29




The NeverFap method of addressing porn addiction comprises of five core principles.

Each principle maintains a purpose, along with a range of associated skills which you must develop in order to successfully address your porn addiction.

Without mastery of all five of these principles, we cannot hope to consistently manage the emotions, thoughts and  behaviours which may be contributing towards our porn addiction.

For more of a relaxed introduction, I highly recommend reading my article The Five Principles Of Neverfap As They Relate To My Life which explains how they apply to my own life.

Before we begin, we must ask ourselves a very important question:


#### What is a fundamental principle and what makes it fundamental?" 


A fundamental principle is a hard truth. It is something which remains true irrespective of whether you agree with it, how you feel about it, nor even how you understand or interpret it.

It simply is.

You may attempt to dispute these fundamental truths or argue against their validity, which is perfectly fine if that is your intention.

However it certainly won't help you overcome porn addiction, which is the primary reason why you're here. You know, to receive help for a problem that you cannot do alone.

My intention on the other hand is very clear. I am here to help you overcome porn addiction.

So in order to do this, we must first set some ground rules and truly understand exactly what we're getting ourselves into.

#### Ground rules" 


The key thing to understand about fundamental principles is that they are not subject to open-ended thinking.

For example:

<hr class="hrul"/>

**"Well, my mind doesn't really work like that."**

**"While that may be true, I don't personally allow it to affect me in that way."**

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

This is not how fundamental principles operate.

Hard truths are not open to subjective questioning. Certainly, you're more than welcome to question them if you like, however it won't help you with your porn addiction.

In fact, there's a very specific word that is used to describe when people refuse to accept the fundamental basis of reality.


#### It's called denial." 


Whether you realise it or not, the reason why you are a porn addict is because you are in denial about some aspect of your life.

Perhaps it is a misunderstanding of what you are capable of as a human being. Perhaps you have a low opinion of your self-worth. Maybe you never had the chance to develop any healthy coping mechanisms growing up.

Ultimately, the aim of these five fundamental principles is to help you expose the fact that there is something wrong with the way you currently think.

As a former porn addict, I encourage you to embrace the idea that everything you know about yourself is wrong, and to not fight the unfamiliar.

You cannot get better if you cannot first recognise that you have a problem.


#### The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap" 


On a superficial level, none of these principles seem to have anything to do with addressing porn addiction.

For example, there is no fundamental principle along the lines of "Never visit a porn website ever again" or "You should never willingly orgasm".

A large part of the reason why this is the case is because porn addiction has very little to do with porn itself.

Rather, porn addiction is merely a symptom of a wider range of problems which NeverFap aims to address.

So without further ado, here are the five fundmental principles of NeverFap:

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">01 - Choice over mind</div></span>
</div>

While all these principles are important in their own right, this is perhaps the one that people tend to struggle with most.

Or rather, it is a way of thinking and understanding which is completely foreign to most of us, and even those of us who do not have a porn addiction.

What **Choice over mind** iterates is the fact that you have complete control over your mind.

This is irrespective of whether you currently feel in control of your mind, whether you agree it's possible to have full control over your mind, or whether you've even experienced having full control over your mind.


#### What's important to understand is that your mind is fundamentally capable of being controlled." 


I would personally say that this fundamental principle is both equal parts understanding and practice.

Certainly while practicing and exercising choice is important, understanding the extent to which we have choice will help us gain the confidence to truly feel comfortable dictating our thoughts, feelings, emotions and behaviour.

By in large, the way this confidence is achieved is through controlled meditation and perspective training, which is covered extensively throughout the NeverFap Deluxe Practices section.

For example, a situation where many porn addicts believe they do not have control is in public.

Many porn addicts (particularly male porn addicts) have a tendency to stare at women they find attractive in public. In particular, control over staring at hot women in public.

Well, I'm here to tell you that with daily practice, we can learn to develop control over our mind, and completely filter the women we walk past in public altogether.

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">02 - Balance over reward</div></span>
</div>

This is one of those concepts that people think they understand, and yet refutely misunderstand simply because of how obliviously unbalanced they are to begin with.

In fact, it's something most people outright ignore because they don't believe it's "that big of a deal", not quite understanding the consequences that ignoring balance can have on their life.

In other words, denial.

What **Balance over reward** maintains is this idea that we must prioritise balance over our immediate wants and goals.

#### Often we become so affixated with something, either through obsession or neglect, we fail to consider the wider ramifications of our actions." 

So we cut corners in order to achieve or experience what we want, only to face the consequences of our actions later.

Not realising that the reason why we're struggling is because of the corners that we've cut.

For example, overworking ourselves is a prominent example of cutting corners in order to achieve something at the immediate harm to both our physical and mental health.

We stay up late to finish what we're working on, ruining our sleep schedule and ability to regulate stress. We most cases, resort to caffeine and porn to keep us energised, resulting in addiction and dysfunction.

#### And yet, we're so focused on the outcome that we don't quite realise what we're even doing wrong." 

Rather, we feel justified in our actions, inspite of the fact that we recognise that we may have a problem with addiction or our mental health.

Even though a) Cutting corners makes you less productive overall than if you were functioning normally and b) Having the added effect of ruining your mental health physical health in the process.

Instead, by learning to respect the principle of balance in your life, you can actually get more done overall without burning out, and without the constant baggage of emotional volatility and stress.

I think part of the problem is that people fall into the trap of believing they're inherently unique when it comes to cutting corners.


#### They think they can somehow \"cheat\" the system and come out ahead." 

Put simply, it's impossible.

No one is immune to their own biology.

Even though people may not show it (in most cases, they simply know how to hide it very effectively), there is a hard limit to what everyone can do on a daily basis without it affecting their mental health.

The point is that if we are to overcome our porn addiction, we must respect this limit and embrace balance in everything we do.

This means taking breaks, even when we want to push forward. This means challenging ourselves, even if we don't feel like it.

And by learning to value and respect these boundaries, you may gain a significant amount of control over your life.


<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">03 - Awareness over all</div></span>
</div>


Awareness is absolutely fundamental to everything we do.

It is what allows us to identify and address the destructive patterns in our life, as well as serve as a stop-gap between our thoughts and our actions.

What **Awareness over all** maintains is that having awareness over our actions is critical to not only understanding the impact those actions may have over our own lives, but also how we can learn to gain control over them.

Without full awareness, we simply cannot hope to act with any amount of intention, nor understand the responsibility we have over them.

#### Instead, we allow our habitual thoughts, emotions and beliefs to take over and continue their self-destructive patterns." 

I think the reason why most people struggle with this concept of awareness is because:

a) They're not currently aware, nor understand how to be aware because it's not something they've ever practiced.

b) Most people struggle to even understand what this concept of awareness actually is. (I was certainly one of them)

In reality, awareness is actually really simple.


#### Awareness is your ability to sense the world around you." 

That's literally it.

It's not about focusing your mind or trying really hard not to think, or even trying to figure out how to empty the thoughts in your mind.

Certainly, they may be useful skills and they may be a consequence of practicing awareness, however the actual action of awareness itself is simple.

#### It is simply being present with your senses." 

Pretty neat, huh?

And when you're present with your senses and what you're feeling, it provides you with the ability to control and gauge your experience.

Witout reaction, and without taking what you're experiencing it personally.

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">04 - Struggle over none</div></span>
</div>

Essentially, the basis of this principle is that the simplest path is often the most efficient.

And as humans, we instinctly do what we find most simple, either for better or worse.


#### Therefore, solutions which are simple by design are going to be more effective than solutions which are convoluted." 


It's the reason why I personally follow the paleo diet and only eat one meal a day.

Doing this is vastly more simple than counting calories, obsessing over when I can eat and organising three meals a day.

In other words, simple is often easy.


#### Certainly, part of the reason why we're addicted to porn in the first place is because it's the easy thing to do." 


Back to the principle itself, what <u>**Struggle over none**</u> relates to is this idea that if you're really struggling with someone, then you're probably not doing it right.

Which means either you're not understanding it intuitively, or you're fundamentally misunderstanding what you're trying to understand.

For example, understanding that porn recovery isn't about fighting yourself or forcing yourself to "get through it".

If at any point you feel like you have to force yourself to do something, then it indicates that you're doing something incorrectly or more importantly, not actually recovering from porn addiction.


#### Because life without porn isn't a struggle." 


It's actually one of the most liberating and empowering things you can do.

The takeaway being that life only ever becomes a chore when we act against it or neglect it.

Especially when it comes to addressing porn addiction.

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">05 - Uncondition over judgement</div></span>
</div>

Much like Balance over reward, this is one of those principles that people tend to ignore, because they underestimate the ramifications of ignoring it.

<u>Uncondition over judgement</u> is about pursing acceptance over judgement.


#### What a lot of people don't realise is that judgement is a mental trap." 


Because when you make a judgement, you essentially trap yourself into a limited point of view.

Of course, the reason why it may not seem like a mental trap is because at first, making one judgement isn't going to kill you.

But humans never just make one judgement.

We make thousands of judgements each and everyday, each time moulding our perception of who we are and what we know.

And when we make enough of these judgements, they can form into habits of belief which prevent us from exercising awareness.

#### After all, how can you be aware of what's going on in your mind, if your mind is in a constant state of habitual thinking?" 

The more judgements you make, the more awareness you trade, and the more faith that gets placed into ideas of who you are and what the world is.

It becomes a trap because without realising it, through judgement you end up in a state of habitual unawareness, full of harmful behaviours that we have no idea how to control or influence.

Now imagine trying to address something like porn addiction under this state of mind.

It becomes almost impossible.

Because guess what happens when you invest all your faith into a bunch of fruitless ideas?

#### You end up having no capacity to address the problems in your life which actually has meaning, like your porn addiction." 

Remember, there are consequences to everything you do in life, whether you realise it or not.

So there you go.

The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap.

Hopefully you have a better idea of what the Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap are, as well as what they represent.

They exist to help guide you through your porn recovery journey, as well as help you make healthy decisions.

If ever you get confused about anything, it can help to come back to these five principles, or try to assess what you might be doing incorrectly.

#### Because at the end of the day, overcoming porn addiction is completely within your reach." 

You just have to know exactly what you're doing and why.

Moving forward I recommend checking out the article index which contains further information in regards to the NeverFap method of overcoming porn addiction.



# The Five Principles Of NeverFap As They Relate To My Life
 2019-01-07




To be quite honest, the five principles are quite arbitrary.

Which is to say that they're meaningless until you develop a personal understanding of how they apply to your own life.

While my article The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap is a good introduction into what they are, today I want to talk about what they actually mean in my own everyday life.

Because theory is one thing, however you may derive additional benefit from understanding how this theory applies to everyday situations.

Hopefully you can relate.

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">01 - Choice over mind</div></span>
</div>

Choice over mind reminds me that I'm always in control of myself.

It reminds me that I have the ability to control how I feel, control what I do, as well as control my reaction to life itself. 

Essentially, it's a principle which gives me confidence over my porn addiction. 

It gives me the confidence to understand that no matter what, I ultimately decide what my relationship with porn is.

I understand that if I struggle with porn, it's not because I've lost control (in part because it's not possible to lose control, as opposed to simply making a bad decision).

But rather, because I'm understanding some aspect of myself, which is causing me to struggle in some way.

In addition, having this understanding helps me not take my relationship with porn personally.

So in summary, Choice over mind helps me maintain that vital "I've always got this" mentality. 

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">02 - Balance over reward</div></span>
</div>

Balance over reward is perhaps the one principle I struggle with most. 

As an entrepeneur of sorts, I'm rather obsessed with getting stuff done. As a result, I tend to overwork myself and even worse, develop mania and obsession in order to maintain this productivity.

In other words, I struggle with bipolar disorder.

And let me tell you, it is almost impossible to overcome something like porn addiction, when your emotions are completely out of whack.

Yet, there is a solution. 

Essentially, by embracing balance as a fundamental principle, I've been able to avoid getting to a point of complete mania and obsession, and therefore not experience those highs and lows which derail long-term goals such as refraining from porn. 

What does this entail?

Obviously, meditation helps significantly in terms of training my mind to be calm.

However I would say the biggest thing that helps is simply realising when I need to stop working.

Previously, I would continue working and writing up until before I had to go to bed, which would result in sleepless nights and would even result in 'coding nightmares'.

What usually happens now on the other hand, is that I will simply stop doing any work around an hour and a half before bed, and that does a fine job of preventing mania and obsession from fully taking hold.

Sometimes I may still slip into mania if I've been working particularly hard up until then, however the hour and a half is enough for me to calm down and switch my mind off. 

During that time I usually stretch, meditate and relax (usually by playing video games or watching YouTube videos).

Initially it was really hard to stop myself from working. 

In fact, the very idea of forcing myself to play video games and not work was something that I found hilarious, but I also knew that if I didn't relax, I'd ultimately be doing my mental health a disservice.

Now that I have this balance in my life however, I have much more control over my emotions and my attitude towards productivity has changed. 

I now realise that I am more productive by being balanced, and that I have more control over my life as a result.

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">03 - Awareness over all</div></span>
</div>

I love being aware of my feelings and emotions. 

It's like having a super power where you can instantly recognise what is happening within your head at any moment in time.

Awareness helps me with my porn addiction by allowing me to recognise behaviours and trends ahead of time, so I don't get stuck within them.

What this means for me is recognising what I should be paying attention to in different situations. 

In that sense, Awareness is like that big brother which helps keep you together. 

That thing which helps ground you and which allows you to default to a healthy coping mechanism, instead of splurging on porn and excess.

It is what allows me to always be in control, as well as remain calm and collected irregardless of what may be happening external to my brain.

For example, If I'm on public transport and there are a lot of pretty women around, I remind myself that I just need to effortlessly relax and focus on myself.

If I'm feeling stressed, I remind myself to time out and go for a walk.

Awareness is like a sedative that makes you more awake.

It is what helps me cope effortlessly when life is difficult, and I simply couldn't see myself not being a porn addict without it.


<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">04 - Struggle over none</div></span>
</div>

Struggle over none is all about understanding that which we misunderstand.

It's about understanding that we do have choice over what happens in life, and that there's no reason what-so-ever to take it personally when we feel out of control.

In other words, it's about having empathy for yourself.

We all have periods where we struggle. 

We may be struggling with how to deal with others. We may be struggling with a difficult problem we've been tasked to solve at work. We may even be struggling figure out the best way to address our emotions. 

During these times, this principle is here to remind you: 

"That's totally fine. There's no reason to react. I fully accept what I'm feeling as merely a by-product of misunderstanding, and there's nothing necessarily wrong with these negative feelings."

In contrast, my previous self would usually try to fight back.

I would fail to recognise my struggle as a misunderstanding, and instead I would assume it was because I wasn't trying hard enough, or because my emotions were becoming unmanagable.

Which would obviously make everything worse, eventually leading to relapse in some form. 

When I struggle with my feelings and emotions now, I actually feel rather calm on some level.

I embrace and recognise those emotions as something not to take personally and I relax into them. 

I don't take them personally, and I thank them for explaining to me that I'm personally doing something incorrect which is causing me to feel this way. 

After all, it's really hard to take something personally and react to it when you accept and acknowledge something for what it is.


<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">05 - Uncondition over judgement</div></span>
</div>

This is the principle most porn addicts generally struggle with at first. 

Of course, being judgemental is not a problem specific to porn addiction itself, however it is certainly a strong contributor towards it. 

In a sense, this principle is sort of the opposite to Awareness over all. 

Because what judgements essentially do is take power away from your ability to be aware. 

And it's impossible to observe and be aware of what is taking place in our minds, if your minds are constantly focusing on creating new thoughts and incessantly describing reality.

Certainly, I used to be a very judgemental person, often in ways that I didn't recognise as even being judgements.

For example, I used to incessantly scan women in public, trying to find attractive ones to obsess over. 

Overtime I've learnt not to judge at all, simply because I realise is serves no purpose in regards to cultivating my mental health.

Largely through meditation.

<hr/>

Well, I hope that's helped you gain a better understanding of The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap and how they apply to my own life.

If you'd like to learn more, I'd recommend going over my article The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap which does into more details from a theoretical perspective.


# The One Rule Of NeverFap
 2018-11-06




Let's discuss a NeverFap best case scenario.

Here are a list of metrics that reflect a very healthy attitude towards life.

<hr class="hrul"/>

- You no longer watch porn.
- You no longer crave watching porn.
- Pornography isn’t something you ever think about, at all. 
- You no longer stare at women in public. You don’t even notice them.
- You see women as other human beings, no more special than you.
- You no longer judge other human beings, including yourself. 
- You have control over your mind and thoughts. 
- You’re conscious of your feelings and emotions. 
- You’re happy with yourself and accept every single aspect of who you are.
- You’re comfortable with your emotions, both positive and negative. 
- You’re confident because you understand yourself. 
- You don’t engage in self-harm of any kind.
- You’re motivated and ambitious.
- You’re committed to your mental health.

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

Fancy pants.

Now go out there and buy yourself a Golden Globe. 

You deserve it buddy, now that you fully understand exactly what you must achieve in life.


#### If it weren't for the fact that lists like these are utterly meaningless." 


Here's the deal.

We're not going to concern ourselves with goals and ideals. 

Instead, what we're going to do is focus on hard processes and practices that will help us move forward.


#### We're going to focus on the things we can do everyday in order to improve as a person." 


Because at the end of the day, there are no such things as "ideal outcomes" or "best case scenarios". 

They're merely predefined ideas which exist in our head.

Ideas which we use to judge ourselves, as a tool of comparison against these imaginary boundaries. A tool which neither contributes towards our mental health, nor empowers us in any way. 

Instead, we need to recognise that there are only ever actions. 

#### Actions which since you were born, have defined who you are today." 

And which will define who you will become tomorrow.

That's what we're interest in. Movement, not ideas.

Movement is what helps us get to our destination, not describing what that destination ideally should be.

This is why much of the content on this website is built around verifiable practices, so that you can actively improve and make changes to your life on a regular basis.

Ultimately, there is only one rule of NeverFap.

#### Practice. Practice. Practice." 

Consistent hard work and practice are the only ideals which you should strive towards.

Everything else is pure fluff, no matter how impressive it may sound in a list of glorified achievements.

Because I can assure you that you don't overcome porn addiction by glorifying a list of ideals.

Instead, I commit myself to respecting fundamental principles. I work hard to practice my mental health on a daily basis, and I put in a lot of ground work to ensure that I can become a better person tomorrow.

And you know the best thing about focusing on your actions?

#### Everything just appears to work and come together, without you even having to worry about it." 

That is the magic of hard work and simplicity.

Put in the work and everything else will fall into place.










# What Makes NeverFap So Different
 2018-11-23




NeverFap Deluxe aims to be a comprehensive solution towards addressing your porn addiction. 

While there are many resources out there on the internet which accurately describe what porn addiction is and how it functions. 

I couldn't find a single resource that could accurately tell me <u>exactly what I needed to do</u> in order stop being a porn addict.

Which is a bit like saying: "Hey buddy, you have a severe problem, but I won't actually tell you how to address it".

"However what I'll do instead is make you increasingly aware of it, so that you feel compelled to do something about it, even though I can't actually help you to change."

Which really is of no help to you, regardless of how useful their information is at describing what your problems are.

Ultimately, there were two kinds of resources that I frequently came across:

<hr class="hrul"/>

**Incomplete advice from existing porn addicts, usually in the form of forum posts. Which were desperately hopeful at best.**

**Scientific descriptions of porn addiction is and how it affects various aspects of our mind.**

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

Certainly, while it's great to understand what happens under the hood from a scientific point of view.

In no way does that actually help you deal with the day-to-day of being a porn addict, and in no way does it help dealing with being a porn addict any easier.


#### So lieu of all this, I decided to create NeverFap Deluxe." 


NeverFap has one very clear purpose that other methods lack: 

<u><b>To help you successfully overcome porn addiction.</b></u>

And thus easily overcome porn addiction.

The reason why NeverFap works is because it is built around verifiable steps and practices, which actively change the way you feel and think on a daily basis.

Using these practices, I have personally overcome porn addiction to a point that I literally do not think about porn at all. 

In addition, the NeverFap method of overcoming porn addiction has been built around Five Fundamental Principles that relate to my own life personally.

Which serve to help you not only gain a better understand yourself, but also cut through the denial of being a porn addict.


#### Porn is not the problem"  


Aside from the fact that NeverFap is a complete solution that aims to take you from porn addict to regular human being.

I also believe NeverFap takes a very unique approach towards addressing porn addiction.

You see, I maintain a very strong belief that porn addiction has very little to do with porn itself. 

Understandably, watching and masturbating to porn is an incredibly addictive behaviour. 

However this doesn't explain why some people aren't severe porn addicts in the same way that were are. Much in the same way that some people are not addicted to alcohol in the same that others may be. 

And this is precisely where I believe scientific descriptions of porn addiction break down in terms of their usefulness at helping us overcome porn addiction.

Sure. It's interesting to understand how porn addiction works, but it still doesn't quite explain why some people are absolutely obsessed with it.

<u>Which is to say that I don't believe porn is the underlying issue as to why we are addicted to porn</u>.

Rather, I believe that porn addicts are addicted to porn because of some sort of fundamental misunderstanding that they have subscribed to, which they haven't yet figured out.

Not only is this a reflection of my own experiences with battling porn addiction, however is a reflection of the actual practices and solutions out there which work to help us address porn addiction.


#### What are we misunderstanding?" 


When you think about it, no one ever wants to be addicted. 

No one wants to self-harm and pursue behaviours which cause them suffering and misery. 

The only reason they do, often inspite of trying everything in their power not to, is due to this internal misunderstanding.

In some cases, this misunderstanding can be due to a limiting belief they have about their own ability to overcome porn addiction. 

In other cases, they may simply not have the mental capacity to influence their emotions in order to prevent cravings, usually due to lack of practice with meditation and perspective exercises.

In most cases, it's a combination of a number of factors, which they simply haven't figured out yet. 

#### This is why I came up with the Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap, to help guide people towards understanding exactly where they may be going wrong." 

Perhaps what I like most about NeverFap is how it's designed to always provide you with a path forward.

When you're a porn addict, almost everything is confusing. 

You doubt yourself. You second-guess what you're experiencing. And even though you may know you're doing the right thing, your emotions may be fighting you and telling you to do otherwise.  

With NeverFap there's always an opportunity to try and figure out where you went wrong, and figure out exactly where you're at and how to address your weak points. 

After all, at the end of the day overcoming porn addiction is nothing more than a skill, and it's a skill you can gain through practice. 

The more you practice, the more you build up your confidence and your ability to control how you feel about yourself, and eventually you'll be able to fully control whatever outcomes you desire. 

Because I've done it using this very same method, and you can too. 

That's my guarantee.

 2018-11-13




It's a question you've probably been thinking about for a while.

**“Why am I a porn addict?”**

Questioning why we may have become porn addicts within the first place is a place where a lot of people start out with their porn recovery journey.

Usually it entails reasoning along the lines that we must first figure out why we watch porn, and then target that thing which we believe is the root cause of our addiction.


#### After all, it seems like an incredibly logical and reliable thing to do." 


In a lot of cases, this kind of questioning leads us to the conclusion that the reason why we're porn addicts is because porn itself is an addictive behaviour.

Which again, makes sense logically, especially if you spend a lot of time reading up on how porn and masturbation affects our dopamine levels.

Therefore, a lot of porn addicts then come to the conclusion that the only way to deal with their addiction is through discipline.

In the hope that they can somehow get past their cravings long enough that they can then refrain from relapsing and end up remaining stable within the process.

...and it's these kinds of approaches which form part of the reason why most people don't get very far with their porn recovery.

Which stems solely from first attempting to understand why we are the way we are.

#### In fact, trying to understand why we are porn addicts at all, is one of the biggest traps that recovering porn addicts fall into."

Put simply, the reason why this is the case is because it's a lot less relevant to figuring out how to change it. 

It’s like trying to figure out your life purpose by asking the question:

**“Why do I exist?”**

Well, I can tell you now that why you exist has no correlation to what purpose you have in life. 

You can have purpose for absolutely any reason imaginable, as you can be a porn addict for any number of reasons. 

On the other hand, if you actually want to figure out your life purpose, then I suggest doing a heap of things and seeing what sticks.


#### You see, you don't figure out what you want in life by thinking about it." 


You figure out what you want by experiencing it, and then evaluating that experience.

Overcoming porn addiction is no different. 

At it's core it's about doing a heap of different things and seeing what works and what does not.

Of course, you obviously don't need to be so brash and uninformed with your approach.

Much like how you don't need to murder someone to realise that you probably don't want to become a full-time murderer.

There are plenty of guides and resources out there to help you overcome your porn addiction. 


#### The great thing about NeverFap Deluxe is that you no longer have to waste your time doing things that do not work." 
 

If you commit to the practices and exercises on this website, and you'll pretty much be alright. 

Otherwise, the alterative is to continue asking 'why' and hope that we have some sudden spark of awareness which will magically alter our brain so as not to pursue the behaviours we've been doing since we were a young child.

Good luck with that.

In fact, there’s a word used to describe what it means to incessantly ask 'why' all the time. 


#### It’s called rumination." 

And I personally consider it a form of self-harm.

Rumination is when you continually spur over your thoughts, without actually pursuing any hard actions as a result.

Understandably, it is an instinctive human response to ask why. 

But when we do it excessively, it serves no purpose and it becomes a literal bottleneck in terms of affecting our ability to process and produce information. 


#### Which is to say that asking why is great for creating an initial assessment, however beyond that it becomes nothing more than a harmful burden." 


If we look at something like learning to play basketball, it's clear there are a number of key skills we must learn. 

For example, there's dribbling, shooting, blocking and learning to run with the ball. 

It doesn’t matter if you don't understand what materials a basketball is made of, nor even who invented basketball. 

Regardless of what your understanding of the sentiment behind basketball, those are the core skills you are going to have to learn.  





#### Another way of putting it is that we must focus on the how, rather than the why." 

If it helps you can think of the understanding is the 'why', while the core skills are the 'how'.

When we focus on how to achieve something, we no longer become concerned with trying to define our circumstances using pre-existing knowledge. 

Instead, we become actively focused on actions which will help us change our reality for the better. 

Questions such as: 

<hr class="hrul"/>

**"How am I a porn addict?"** 

**"What do I on a daily basis which makes me a porn addict?"** 

**"What do I have to do in order to avoid porn addiction?"**

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

From reasons to tangible processes, you also completely change the way you think about your own problems. 

No longer do they become about building narratives or perceptions of who you are. Instead, they become about the mechanical details of what makes you a porn addict.

Because at the end of the day, addiction is a process. 

It is something you actively engage in and contribute towards, whether you quite realise it or not. 

And although attempting to understand why you may be engaged in this process may seem useful, it is also a really indirect way of trying to influence how it functions. 

To be a little bit more precise, here are a list of the whys which you shouldn't concern yourself with:

<hr class="hrul"/>

**"Why am I a porn addict?"**

**"Why do I find overcoming porn addiction so difficult?"**

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

These are all meaningless questions. 

Instead, these are the types of questions we need to be thinking about:

<hr class="hrul"/>

**"What can I do to influence my porn addiction?"**

**"What are the steps leading up to when I watch porn?"**

**"How do I think about women?"**

**"How do I fall into the trap of believing that it’s okay to watch porn?"**

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

Aside from the rest of the introductory articles on this website, I highly recommend taking a look at some of the practices on offer, so you can begin to make actual changes to your life today.

Hopefully this article clarifies the change of thinking that needs to take place, in order for us to overcome our porn addiction.






# The Easiest Way To Identify A Judgement
 2019-02-24


Some people have a hard time identifying the judgements they make on a daily basis.

It could be because they judge out of habit and therefore are doing it subsciously without realising it, or perhaps because they're simply unable to recognise a judgement once they've made one.

Certainly, I had no idea about the extent to which I was subsconsiously making judgements, and it took me years to personally identify them all and dissolve the negative habit for good.

Of course, I'm writing this article today so you can have a much easier time identifying the judgements you make on a daily basis, so you can live your life relatively burden free.

Essentially, it all comes down to a super simple technique we can use to instantly identify the judgements we make throughout the day.

And furthermore, it's a technique that doesn't require paying a therapist hundreds of dollars per hour for the privilege.


#### The technique is to pay attention to your emotional reactions." 


Your emotion reactions are a key indicator of whether you've made a judgement or not, and in order to understand how this works, we need to understand what emotional reactions are.

For starters, emotional reactions don't simply appear out of thin air. 

They exist as a reaction to an event, usually in regards to a thought we have about something.

Enter judgements. 


#### You see, judgements are much more than mere thoughts." 


If they were just like any other thought, then much like most other thoughts we have, they would disappear completely from our conscious never to bother us again.

For example, while most of us are unable to remember any thoughts or opinions we had of the weather more than a few weeks ago, let alone the day before. 

Most of us can probably remember a time when our parents made us do something that upset us greatly, even if these events may have taken place more than a decade ago.

In essence, what makes judgements different is that unlike typical thoughts that come and go, judgements are thoughts that we have put significant faith into and belief into.

And it's this reason why they can be so destructive.

For example, a lot of us make the judgement that we're not good enough and that we should try harder as a result (also known as self-criticism).



#### And when we make these judgements, we dictate how we're going to react on an emotional level." 

We come up with these deterministic narratives like:

<b>"If that person doesn't shut up, I'm going to get so mad!"</b>

<b>"If I fail this test, I'm going to feel so helpless and depressed."</b>

In a lot of cases, we won't even necessarily vocalise these agreements and instead, we'll imply them in our actions.

For example, we might get really tense when we're mad or stressed.

And what can happen over time is that we may not even generate the thought or physica response anymore, and simply skip straight to the emoiton.

For example, feeling sad because we don't have a girlfriend, or getting upset because things aren't going our way.

Certainly, these hidden agreements form part of the reason why these judgements can be so hard to identify, because often they take place completely out of conscious sight. 


#### Yet from the perspective of our emotional reactions, they are never hidden."


Because although these agreements and beliefs are often hidden, the direct effect of those judgements are fully felt via the emotional reactions which shut us down and hold us completely at ransom.

Via the emotional horror that pursues.

This is when we feel the effect of those judgements most, and so paying attention to what you're feeling can be a key indicator as to whether you're making a judgement or not.

Only until we can identify these judgements through our emotional reactions, can we finally move on and learn not to react, instead choosing to remain calm and level-headed.



Of course, you're probably wondering. I'm making all these judgements, but what can I actually do about them?

How is identifying them going to help?


#### Well, the great thing is that we don't need to go any further than simple acknowledgement." 


Because anything further you do at this point, is unnecessary rationalisation which is the exact opposite of what we are trying to achieve, which is to learn to let go and remain relaxed.

Effectively, what we want to do is learn to let go of these judgements, and learn to simply function regardless of them. 

Where people often go wrong is that they feel trapped once they've identified these judgements, as if they've done some great evil, feeling the need to dissect them or rectify these behviours and habits.

The funny thing is that this behaviour within itself is an emotional reaction, brought about by judgement. For example, you may have the judgement that you're not good enough, and therefore feel the need to do something about it. 


#### This in part signifies the extent to which a lot of the judgements are simply subconscious habit." 


As well as why it's important that we address these judgements and hidden agreements now, rather than let them continue to develop. 

Of course, many of us have been making these judgements since childhood, so it won't happen overnight.

Just remember that no matter our emotional reaction or judgement, our go-to response is to acknowledge that we've experienced an emotional reaction due to judgement, and to simply move on.

Once you acknowledge something, not only does it help take you out of the reaction, which helps you in terms of remaining calm and refraining from reacting further.

However it helps build your self-awareness and ability to identify these judgements in future.

Of course, like anything practice makes perfect.

And by using healthy coping mechanisms such as meditation and awareness exercises, we can go a long way towards developing control over our judgements and emotions.




# Balance Is The Reward
 2019-07-06





For a number of people suffering from mental health issues, balance is often seen as a weakness. 

After all, it's part of the reason why they ended up mentally ill in the first place, and certainly it's a point of view I can personally relate to from my own experiences with mental illness.

Well, I'm here to tell you otherwise.


#### In fact, I'm here to tell you that balance is actually a reward, far greater than you may realise." 


With balance comes an absurd amount of benefits, and that is something I would like to share with you today.

For starters, a lot of people assume balance is snonymous with being 'normal' or 'boring'. As if we're attempting to maintain some sort of insufferably average life devoid of any pain or pleasure. 

While this is may be true in some cases for some people, this kind of thinking doesn't truly capture the essence of what balance is about.

Instead, balance can merely be thought as a counter-balance to our more destructive side. 

Balance isn't telling you not to go absolutely wild, and live your life in the face of fear. 


#### It's telling you to go crazy, but then meditate for 10 minutes after in order to calm down." 


It's the yin and yang of balance that people often forget, which is so vital to ensuring that we're effective.

And it lends itself to a wide range of different fears some people maintain towards adopting mental health best practice in their lives.

Also known as having self-limiting beliefs.

One common self-limiting belief people have, is that by adopting balance and proper mental health practice into our lives, that it's going to result in inherently losing part of ourselves. 


#### Most often, the fun quirkiness that is our personality." 


Yet this simply isn't the case. The great thing about balance is that it allows you to have your cake and eat it too. 

Again, balance isn't necessarily about removing the craziness from your life. It's about providing you with the insurance in order to ensure that you can keep on top of it all.

And not get caught up in the depression and anxiety that usually results from an unbalanced mind. 

Ultimately, balance should be viewed as an opportunity to experience something more.

To experience the effectiveness of not only being in control over your mind, but also be comfortable with your feelings and emotions, even if they may be a bit wild.


#### Of course, an important thing to keep in mind is that it's also a very different way of thinking for most." 


A way of thinking which a lot of people find limiting, because they're now holding themselves accountable for their actions.

Which can be quite scary a lot of people, simply due to the denial of realising that they even have a problem in the first place, which previously they had been putting aside and ignoring. 

Yet the funny thing is that we always were accountable for our actions irrespective of whether we respected those boundaries or not.

It's the very reason why we feel intense sadness or depression, precisely because we have broken those boundaries and are now experiencing the effect of our actions.

Instead, it merely reinforces these negative behaviours and emotions and leaves us even more confused and hopeless when we do eventually experience them.

Only by maintaining balance can we ensure that we not only keep on top of these negative habits, but also learn to remain calm while doing so.

















# The Importance Of Letting Go
 2019-05-20


Some people have a difficult time letting go.

For example, some people will continue to latch onto negative feelings, regardless of whether these feelings are productive, let alone help us feel empowered about who who we are. 

Others have a hard time letting go of their own thoughts, as they find themselves paralyzed in indecision, stuck in a cycle of incessant rationality and self-judgement.

Failure to let go may even extend to the toxic people in our lives, or even the self-limiting beliefs we have about ourselves, that we're simply "not good enough" or "undeserving" of love and attention.

Regardless of what it is we're struggling with, the solution all points to the same thing.


#### Learning to let go and learning to become free of these unproductive attributes." 


Of course, if it were as simple as walking away, none of us would have any problems and we'd all be clear of our addiction and a-ok to continue with our lives.

Well, today I'm here to discuss not only the importance of letting go, but also how you can achieve this purpose by changing the way we think about attachment.

Part of the reason why people struggle with letting go, is because there's a great fear and misunderstanding surrounding this idea of what letting go truly is.

At first glance people will usually assume the worst.

They'll view letting go as this process of inherently losing something. 

In particular, losing a part of themselves that they believe to be not only valuable, but irreplaceable. 

A part of themselves which they've contributed towards for so long, that they can no longer distinguish between themselves from 'it'.

Under these circumstances, letting go then becomes this deep-seated fear of loss, potentially leaving this hollow shell of nothingness which we may end up regretting.


#### Well, I'm here to tell you that this makes no sense what-so-ever." 


You see, you don't actually lose anything by letting go.

There is no 'void' once something leaves. 

If you think of the conscious human experience as a bunch of brain waves moving forward, those waves don't suddenly disappear the moment you let something go.

Nor do you experience less waves, nor more.

The only time this ever happens is when you die, and since you're still very much alive and conscious once you let go, nothing is even lost in a metaphysical sense.

Those brain waves will still keep chugging along at the same rate as they did prior to when you didn't let go.

So what actually happens then?


#### Well, what happens is that it allows you to experience different waves." 


Much like those brain waves which are being produced each second, it can help to think of the brain as a conveyor belt in an ice-cream factory. 

Regardless of which flavour of ice-cream you decide to produce, that conveyor belt is still going to be producing ice-cream none-the-less. 

If you think of all the awful things in your life as terrible flavours of ice-cream, then letting go of them isn't going to suddenly stop producing ice-cream.

Instead, what happens is quite remarkable.

What happens is that you begin producing neutral, vanilla ice-cream. 

Not worse ice-cream, just normal, plain ice-cream. 

And you know what? Plain ice-cream tastes a hell of a lot better than bad ice-cream.

Which is to say that by letting go of those awful flavours, you essentially allow yourself the opportuinty to start from scratch and create new amazing ones.

Put simply, you can't make great ice-cream from crap ice-cream. 

You need to start with neutral base and that's essentially what letting go provides.


#### What people don't realise is that letting go is in fact an opportunity." 


It's an opportunity to experience something new. Something exciting. Something magical. 

Of course, half the challenge is that people remain so devoid of experiencing anything nice, that they therefore assume that these 'non-awful' experiences simply don't exist.

Well, they do - as long as you change your understanding of loss and fear in relation to letting go, as I've mentioned in this article.

Often what can help is to simply commit to the process without expectation. A lot of the time that's how I approach my gym workouts. 

Because sometimes feelings simply disagree. Sometimes you don't feel like working out, but that doesn't denote the importance of why you should be working out consistently.

So how do you effectively let go?

Well, like anything in life, it simply comes down to a matter of practice and consistency.

There are quite a few exercises in our practices section of the NeverFap Deluxe website, which are designed to help dissolve your ego.

And help you dissociate from your thoughts and feelings, so your ability to enact conscsious action can be exercised in full.

**What Can Your Hand Do?** and **Stop Absolutely Everything You're Doing** are good places to start for most people, although each exercise provides a different focus. 

Essentially, anything which can help you challenge that feeling of obligation you have not to let go, can certainly help on a cognitive and mental level.

So get crackin' buddy. Your mental health won't sort itself out without you.




# The Trick Is To Realise That Nothing Is Important
 2019-06-02


I just thought I'd take the time today to share a cool trick I'd learnt over the years in regards to helping people overcoming difficult situations.

An important thing to note about difficult situations, is that often it isn't even the situations themselves which make them difficult.

Often, it's our own inability to respond to these situations, which makes them inherently difficult.

Either we become too anxious, we find ourselves trapped in fear or we act in a way that is counter-productive without truly realising or understanding why.


#### Which is to say that more often than not, the problem is us." 


This is in part due to the self-limiting beliefs we may have about ourselves, as well as what responding effectively might entail. 

In particular, a lot this ineffectiveness stems from our fear of letting go or the consequences of what might happen if we were to let go of these self-limiting beliefs.

Which ironically leads to self-destructive behaviours since self-perceived fear in no way conveys any indication of safe behaviours moving forward, only behaviours to avoid.

Which usually prevents us from proceeding with those helpful actions we were aiming for to begin with.

Certainly, while self-limiting beliefs aren't something which can be dismantled overnight, there's a certain mindset which I find helps deal with these situations.


#### In particular, the trick is to realise that nothing is important." 


In essence, by learning to treat everything as unimportant, we can learn to dissasociate ourselves from these self-limiting beliefs, and instead just go with the flow. 

In other words, this is an exercise in distrusting ourselves. 

Now, although it may seem like reckless advice, it's actually incredibly sound when you get into the logic of how this mindset interacts with the way we think about our ego. 

When you make the statement "nothing is important" you're actually making a very essential claim about yourself and the situation. 


#### In particular, that nothing is ever important enough to self-harm or do harm." 


You see, you're not preventing anything positive here by learning to let go and assume everything is unimportant - primarily because there was nothing positive to begin with. 

If all you know is self-destructive behaviours, which in most cases is true, then detaching from them certainly isn't a negative thing.

Oh, but what if there are some constructive behaviuors in the mix, you might say? 

Well, that's also irrelevant because in actual fact, what we are doing here is much more profound than that promoting certain behaviours.

Instead, what we are doing is learning to calm down and get ourselves to a point of non-reaction.

You see, the problem in most cases when we're irrational or feeling compulsive is that we develop this desire to react in some way. 

In a lot of cases it's instinctual. 

We feel awful. We feel obliged to do something about it, only to end up relapsing or doing something harmful like eat an entire bag of chips.


#### However what people don't realise is that in 90% of cases, the correct thing to do is not react." 


In fact, that's part of the core tennant of what NeverFap Deluxe is all about, learning to remain calm and composed inspite of what you're feeling.

To go into more detail, essentially 5% of our time should be spent practicing awareness via meditation, while the other 95% of our time should be spent remaining calm.

Furthermore, the sooner you realise that you have no obligation to react, the sooner you'll be able to act more effectively out of principle. 

Another key thing to note about obligation is that it's merely a feeling.

And by understanding that nothing is important, we can directly challenge this feeling in a way that bypasses it entirely. 

The sooner you learn to dismantle your ego and your thoughts, the quicker you'll be able to help yourself in a more constructive way.

In particular, by remaining in control. 




# When Are You Fully Recovered From Your Porn Addiction?
 2019-06-11


A lot of people starting out with their porn addiction recovery journey ask me something along the lines of:

#### \"How do I know when I'm fully recovered from my porn addiction?\"" 

Well, believe it or not, there actually is a very comprehensive way to know whether you're fully recovered or not.

Put simply, you're fully recovered once you have full confidence in your ability to overcome your porn addiction.

Which is to say that you're 100% certain that you have every possible skill and insight required to deal with every possible situation without relapsing.

If you have that confidence and those skills, then quite simply, you'll never relapse again.

On the other hand, if you have even the slightest doubt that you'll be able to deal with any possible situation, then you are not recovered.

For example, do you think you would relapse if a close friend/family member passed away tomorrow? What if you were to find yourself suddenly homeless, or if you ended up losing your job?

If you feel as if you would relapse under those circumstances, then you haven't fully recovered, because you haven't developed the skills to deal with those situations.

#### Ultimately, porn addiction recovery is about building our tolerance to effectively deal with difficult situations."

So you may be perfectly fine with only being 80% confident in your ability not to relapse, however obviously the purpose of our recovery is to reach a point of 100% confidence.

And really, coming to understand what it means to be "fully recovered" within this context is super important, because it also tests what we know about ourselves.

Would I personally say that I have 100% confidence in my ability to refrain from relapsing? 

Definitely not. 

Like, I would say that I'm able to deal with 90% of situations with ease, but for example, if you were to force me to watch an hour of porn, I'm not sure how I would cope.

Of course, part of the problem is that we simply have no idea if we're going to cope, nor whether what we know about ourselves is even correct.

Which is to say that although we may feel certain at times, this isn't to say that we truly understand ourselves, let alone truly understand what it means to be "certain". 

And that's cool, because in most lot of cases it's merely a matter of experience and testing out our awareness in different situations in order to build that tolerance towards stress, anxiety and all manner of difficult emotions. 

In fact, a large part of porn addiction recovery comes down to rediscovering this idea of "certainty" and what it actually means to have those skills and abilities

Sometimes it may help to ask.

#### What does certainty entail? Is certainty purely emotional? Is certainty a process?"

How can I guarantee certainty 1 week from now, let alone within 3 months time?

If you don't have 100% confidence in the answers you have to these questions, then it means you still have some experimenting to do.

And that's fine, because ultimately this is a process of self-discovery.

There are no cheap hacks or quicks ways of getting around this. The only way to achieve a high level of certainty is to practice meditation and awareness exercises each and everyday. 

So you can develop the skills in order to address those tough situations, as well as gradually dissect this puzzle I'm sure you've been trying to figure out for a while.

With this said, there's also no point me telling you what I think certainty is, because it entirely defeats the purpose of what we're trying to achieve here.


#### Only by consistently working on your mental health, will it actually begin to make any sense to you at all."


Reading about it is simply not enough.

And certainly, part of the issue is that we as porn addicts are often delusional.

Often we think we'll have it down, only to find ourselves completely depressed and hopeless, even though there'll be no reason to be feeling that way at all.

Which is also to say that this concept of "certainty" is a funny one.

Essentially, the point I'm trying to make is that your concept of certainty is almost always incorrect, and furthermore, limited by what you currently know.

Thankfully, there's a way around this. 

You see, certainty comes in many forms. There is "knowing" something and then there is "doing" something. 

If you're 100% certain that you'll always "do" that something then you'll be golden.


#### Personally speaking, I knew I was largely recovered from the moment that I discovered proper meditation technique."


Because from that moment, I knew I had all the skills necessary in order to be able to deal with almost all the awful emotions and feelings life was willing to throw at me. 

That's when I'd mentally achieved "certainty".

And within that moment, this whole idea of porn addiction recovery itself became quite clear in my own mind and I've proven myself correct ever since. 

In essence, although overcoming porn addiction may seem like a game of confidence, this is merely a symptom of the real cause.

Which is skill itself.

When you have a high degree of skill, because you've been practicing meditation and awareness execrices everyday, it will provide you with the confidence to be able to approach your porn addiction recovery with absolute certainty. 

You just have to commit to improving them everyday.



# Why You Should Never Depend On Your Emotions
 2019-03-10




One thing that porn addicts are more-than familiar with is this concept of hope and despair.

The hope that comes from the initial excitement of starting their porn recovery process.

And the complete despair that comes from breaking down a week later, when their urge to watch porn becomes unbearable and they decide to relapse. 

A cycle which seems to repeat time and time again.


#### What I want to do in this article is explain the dynamics of this cycle." 


As well as explain how you can put it to an end.

If you think about the key thing which defines these types of cycles, it's really a combination of expectation and emotion.

Expectation being our understanding that, "This is the correct thing to do moving forward, and of course this time will be different".

Emotion being that push which convinces us that what we're experiencing must be true.


#### After all, positive emotions never lie, right?" 


And when you combine those two factors together, what you get is a cocktail of mania so strong, that nothing we do or say can convince us otherwise. 

We're excited. We're motivated. 

In part, because we're feeling so low that we couldn't possibly think of anything better than to actually do something to change.

So although nothing has actually changed in that moment, we feel as if something's changed. 


#### We feel as if we're already there." 


Even though it's just our emotions making us feel that way.

And even though nothing has actually changed in terms of meaningful actions to actually develop self-control and healthy coping mechanisms.

Then what happens is that these emotions eventually fade as the hype dies away. 

We find ourselves vulnerable since those very emotions which we've relied on are now telling us that we really want to watch porn.


#### And then we relapse and start and whole charade again." 


Perhaps the most common example of this is when we use something like fear to try and motivate us.

We fear the consequences of that feeling of failure if we were to relapse. We fear not achieving our life ambitions due to the effects of porn on our life.

Fear which inevitably becomes craving, which becomes fear, which becomes craving, and I'm sure you get the drift.

So what's the alternative?

#### The alternative is to develop proper self-control over our mind." 

The kind of self-control that allows us to dictate what we think, how we feel, as well as detach ourselves from these aspects so we don't take them personally.

The kind of self-control you may believe is impossible.

After all, you may be under the impression that what you've been doing this whole time has been 'self-control'.

When in actual fact, chasing our emotions in this fashion could not be further from actual self-control itself.

#### Self-control is not reliant on how we feel in any way." 

So anytime we pursue any actions or behaviours based on emotion, we essentially train our minds to embrace this instability. 

And over time, we eventually create this habitual understanding that our emotions are truly representative of what we're capable of.

As opposed to this idea that our mind is in control of our emotions.

Hopefully this article helps you better understand exactly what happens in our minds when we pursue this cycle of emotion.

In terms of moving forward, I highly recommend checking out our range of comprehensive NeverFap Practices which are designed to help you regain control over your mind.





# Your Porn Addiction Is Not Who You Are
 2019-02-11






Porn addicts often struggle to dissociate themselves from their addiction.

In part because porn addiction plays on a very primal, and natural human response.


#### Otherwise known as attraction." 


After all, what is the difference between being attracted to a person in front of you, as opposed to a person on your computer screen doing rather promiscuous things?

According to your brain, there really isn't much of a distinguishable difference at all. 

What this effectively does is have us question whether we're truly addicted at all.

You know, because being attracted to other human beings is just one of those things that we seem to do by design, so what then seems to be the big deal?

Which expresses itself into edging, claiming that porn is in fact 'art' and therefore okay in small doses, along a host of hilarious excuses that we can manage to come up with.


#### I am here to tell you that this is purely your addiction trying to convince you otherwise." 


From a mechanical perspective, porn addiction is really quite similar to porn recovery.

The reason why you are addicted to porn because you did not develop the skills and abilities in order to prevent yourself from successfully refraining from watching porn. 

It's not because you genuinely think porn is fascinating, or because you think you can't help yourself because you're a guy, or because you've been watching it since you were 12. 

It's because you never developed the ability.

And what happens is that people don't realise it's nothing more than an ability, and so they come up with all these excuses instead to try and justify their behaviour.


#### Instead, what we're going to do is focus on developing this ability." 


No different to porn addiction, the reason why you will be able to successfully overcome porn addiction, is because you have the skills and abilities to refrain from watching porn.

Not because you've managed to trick your mind into believing that porn is wrong, not because you've successfully managed to use fear to deter yourself from watching porn, nor because you're just a really disciplined person. 

It's because you've managed to develop that ability.

And once you realise this, no longer will you feel compelled to seek any sort of justification for your actions.


#### You simply won't need to." 


Instead, you'll identify them for the excuses they are, and actually focus on actions which will meaningfully impact your porn addiction.

Such as engaging in daily meditation.

More importantly however, you'll come to understand something very important about human will and desire.

Precisely, that it is and always will be completely independent of almost everything and anything.

Which is to say that there is no inherent "meaning" or "purpose" in life.


#### There is only your ability and your commitment towards developing it." 


In the case of porn addiction, it's watching porn everyday and subconsciously reinforcing that behaviour every single day with your actions.

In the case of porn recovery, it's meditating every single day and reinforcing your ability to control your mind.

No one commitment or ability is truly different from the other.

It is merely a choice you make based on what you want from life.

#### Sure, you can claim that you're a porn addict due to x, y and z." 


However this kind of thinking simply isn't reflective of reality, nor can it help you overcome your porn addiction.

Because porn addiction is a process, not a retrospective idea based in any number of infinite possibilities.




# What It Feels Like Not To Be Addicted To Porn
 2019-04-14


One thing which people often ask me is:

#### What does it feel like not to be addicted to porn?" 

And it's an interesting question, because it's something I often think about and I think I've finally found a way to convey this message accurately.

If I had to provide an appropriate analogy which summarises what it feels like not to be addicted to porn, I would ask you to think back to when you were 7 years' old.

Now, for most people this is a rather distant memory. 

I personally remember very little about what my life was like back then, although if I had to approximate I would say that I was in Grade 2 and that I had a relatively simple life.

I don't remember any particular details, the people in it, nor is it something which really evokes any sort of emotion, regret or anything.

It just was a period of time within which I existed, no different to my existence now.


#### Well, that memory kind of sums up how I also feel about my previous porn addiction." 


Which is to say that my porn addiction is a lot like a distant memory to me.

While I remember the attachment and depression that resulted from it, I don't remember a whole lot of the specifics in terms of why I did it, nor even what it felt like.

Furthermore, I don't really have any feelings towards it, since I haven't experienced the guilt, shame and sadness that arose from my habit in quite a very long time.

Instead, you could say that it feels no different to being 7 years' old.


#### From a process point of view, it's actually quite astounding to understand why it's all a distant memory to me." 


For starters, I'm obviously not watching porn.

But let's really dig into what this actually means, because being a porn addict is so much more than just 'watching porn' and turning into a pile of inconspicuous jelly.

From a time perspective, I'm no longer spending hours everyday looking at porn.

Which not only means physically watching porn, but also dedicating time to watch porn which could otherwise be spent on more productive pursuits.

Another aspect which people don't consider is the mental overhead of planning and organising that time as well. 

In my case, it meant consciously thinking about how I could masturbate to porn without my partner knowing, which not only affected my behaviour around her, but my mood as well if I hadn't orgasmed in a while.


#### At it's worst, it was completely controlling my behaviour to a point of absolute obsession." 


There were times where I used to even do it at work, because I'd had a bad day or I was feeling particularly desperate.

I remember when I was working in a very confined office, I went as far as to walk to the local library so I could use my laptop and get a better image, rather than with my phone which I could afford to sneak into the toilet.

You know, much like when I was absolutely obsessed with video games as a 7 year old, to a point where I would cry if my mother didn't let me play. 

Of course, it's funny to look back at these memories and certainly, as awkward as it is to admit some of these things, because I haven't relived these behaviours in such a long time, it no longer affects me personally.


#### Certainly, the biggest thing that's changed is my mental state." 


The behaviours that arose from porn addiction aside, the thing which I've noticed most is the improvement in my energy and mental state.

You know that post-relapse dopamine brain-fog fun-land of hell? 

Well, that's truly a thing of the past and my mind is in a constant state of being level and clear, especially with my daily routine of meditation help balance things out.

I'm no longer irrationally depressed and my emotions are no longer tipping up and down, like a bunch of ADHD kids on a see-saw.

But wow, what a difference.


#### I distinctly remember that feeling of calm I felt when I first started meditating." 


It was mind-boggling. It was like I'd finally felt peace and control for the first time in my porn recovery journey.

It was at that point that I knew I would never be addicted to porn again, because I'd finally discovered a way to effortlessly tame my mind. 

And that's another thing which a lot of people don't realise: When you overcome your porn addiction, life actually becomes easy and enjoyable.

Because your emotions aren't all over the place, it becomes really easy to commit to your goals, and an amazing side effect of this is that you actually become happy.


#### Like, not obsessive happy or manic happy, but just genuinely happy." 


The kind of happiness that doesn't ask anything of you, and which makes you feel completely at peace with yourself.

While it's been a long and arduous journey getting to this point, I can definitely say that once you experience all these wonderful things, you'll never want to go back.

Of course, the hard part is getting to a point where you finally do feel this kind of peace, which is why we emphasise the importance of practice and consistency.

As long as you stick with the process, you will absolutely succeed with your goal of overcoming porn addiction. 

It's also part of the reason why I've put so much effort into crafting this website so that the process can make intuitive sense to you.

I know you can do it.





















# Creating Your First NeverFap Schedule
 2019-02-01




Everything in life revolves around practice. 

No matter what you want to do in life, practice is the means through which we master something.


#### Practice is what will allow us to overcome porn addiction." 


And what you practice is absolutely vital.

In the case of overcoming porn addiction, this means practicing the core skills involved to help you regain control over your mind.

Anything else you practice outside of this, will not meaningfully impact your porn addiction in the same way that having control over your mind will.

And the only way this is going to happen, is if you have an effective routine of practice in place.

This means understanding why these practices are effective, finding the time to actually practice them and most importantly, doing these practices consistently.


#### To start out, I recommend spending approximately 10 minutes per day practicing observation." 


Specifically, the Observe Your Senses practice which explains how to do this in the most simple way possible.

Observation truly is the most fundamental practice you can do in terms of  developing your awarenes, and it is the practice we ask that you commit to every single day.

In part because observation should form the fundamental basis of everything you do.

From how you think to how you perceive the world around you.


#### It's more-or-less the only exercise I personally do." 


In part because I've already spent years doing all those other practices, and they're now less meaningful now that they're engrained into my head.

Whereas because observation is what I would consider "a default state of mind" is something which we need to continually develop on a daily basis.

Certainly, while those other practices are incredibly useful in developing new perspectives, they are merely supplementary.

The aim is that once you feel you have a grasp of Observe Your Senses, you can start adding additional exercises to your routine.


#### Personally speaking, I don't recommend doing more than one additional exercise at a time." 


Which is to say that an ideal routine will consist of doing <u>Observe Your Senses</u> along with one other additional exercise.

Usually it makes sense to commit to these additional exercises for a week, before switching to something else.

Just because doing it only for a day, won't teach us very much in terms of how changing the way we think will truly affect us long-term.

But of course, finding out what personally works for you is important as well.


#### My Personal NeverFap Routine" 


I have a very basic routine which works really well for me.

Essentially, I spend around 40 minutes each day towards developing my awareness.

With a few small key points throughout the day where I periodically zone out and just embrace calm.

Here's how I would break it down:


<hr class="hrul"/>

- <b>15 minutes of meditation as I walk to the train station in the morning for work.</b>
- <b>15 minutes of meditation as I walk to the train station in the morning for work.</b>
- <b>10 minutes of meditation while sitting down in a room, around 15 minutes before bed.</b>

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>


This is the routine that I personally find works superbly well for me, in part because I don't need to necessarily go out of my way to make it happen.

I've simply adapted meditation to my everyday life, and that's what I recommend you do as well.

In almost all cases, I am practicising observation of some kind, although usually encompassing different variations.

I may focus on a very particular sense.

In other cases, I may simply focus on emptying the thoughts from my mind.


#### Regardless, I keep it super simple and that's why it works." 


Another thing to consider is self-care.

Ultimately, the reason why NeverFap works as a solution is because the core philosophy behind it is quite simple.

And self-care is simply another aspect we can focus on, to make things even simpler. 

Certainly, this isn't a focus of this website, so you can certainly do your own research into this.

However below is a list of what I personally do to maintain self-care in my life.


<hr class="hrul"/>

- I eat paleo.
- I do cardio and lift weights three times a week.
- I have a consistent sleep routine.
- I work on my hobbies and ambitions in my spare time.
- I play video games and watch TV to relax.
- I meditate approximately three times a day.
- I work a typical nine-to-five job.
- I brush my teeth in the morning and at night.
- I have a cold shower every night.

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>


The extent to which you maintain self-care is entirely up to you.

In any case, I hope this post has helped you better understand what you can expect from a consistent never 

I encourage you to start small and simply commit to 10 minutes of meditation each day.

That's precisely how I started and to be quite honest, spending 10 minutes each day was enough for me to see significant changes in the way I thought over the space of a few weeks.

So don't feel as if you need to commit all your time to doing this. 

Remember, it's not how much you practice that counts, but what you practice that matters.

In particular, if you feel as if you're struggling to find time to commit to your mental health, I highly recommend reading my article You Always Have Time For Your Mental Health








# The NeverFap State Of Mind
 2019-02-06




This article aims to explore the idea of what it means to have the mindset of someone who does NeverFap.

The thing I love most about NeverFap is that it's designed to make addressing your porn addiction easy.

On a very low level it's about learning to co-exist with your emotions, in order to both avoid experiencing porn cravings altogether, as well as remain neutral when they do arise.

And when you're not taking anything personally and you're not allowing any external influences from changing the way you think and feel...

Well, I couldn't possibly think of anything more effortless than that. 

I truly believe that successful porn recovery requires an effortless approach in order to be effective, which is why I have designed NeverFap to be as effortless as possible. 

If I had to use one word to describe what NeverFap encompasses.

I would use the word:


#### Calm." 


Calm is the default NeverFap state of mind. 

It's not about being excited, determined or ready to dominate the world with your new-found energy.

Those things will not help you sustainably overcome porn addiction.

Instead, it's about being calm.

When you practice the NeverFap Deluxe exercises everyday and apply them to your life, it makes you feel calm and collected. 

In large part because when you practice these exercises which provide you with the required skills and abilities to control your mind, you no longer fear the unknown.


#### Because you know that you have a strategy in place, and you know exactly what to expect from your ability to address your addiction." 


Another part of the reason why being calm and collected is important, is because it becomes really difficult to self-harm or react emotionally when you're feeling calm.

In fact, it becomes almost impossible.

Which is exactly what we want, and is part of the reason why calmness is so wonderful within itself. 


#### Because remaining calm doesn't require any effort." 


In it's truest sense, calmness itself is a lack of effort.

Calmness is the result of letting go of all your thoughts and simply just being. 

Ultimately, it's only possible not to be calm if you're actively doing something to disrupt it.

Whether it be obsessive thinking, feeling or judging - all these things serve to disrupt our default state of being calm.

Of course, you may struggle to remain calm because you've built this habit of obsessively thinking and judging everything around you.

That's okay too.


#### It's simply a matter of following your daily routine of NeverFap Deluxe Practices." 


By commiting to meditation and practices which teach you self-control over your mind, you're making changes to how you think and feel.

And the longer you commit to practicing each and everyday.

The more you change and the closer you get to experiencing completely calmness in your life.

So what are you waiting for?

I recommend checking out our list of NeverFap Deluxe Practices for a list of exercises you can do to develop calmness in your life.





# The Ultimate Aim Of NeverFap Deluxe Practices
 2019-03-01




NeverFap Deluxe consists of a range of exercises which are designed to help you develop the skills in order to help you overcome porn addiction.

The intention is really quite simple:


#### To help you develop healthy coping mechanisms in order to help you deal with your porn addiction." 


Exercises which are designed to not only help expand your capacity for capacity for awareness, however to also teach you to remain calm and relaxed with your feelings and emotions.

Here's the thing: As a porn addict you have trained your mind to watch porn as a go-to response to a variety of difficult situations.

It could as a response to excessive stress due to work or school. It could be due to depression as a result of unsupportive family or friends. It could simply be due to the fact that you've never be taught otherwise.

What these exercises set out to do is reprogram the way you think and respond in these situations. 

#### Essentially, what this means is developing a new set of understandings and behaviours so you don't need to watch porn anymore to cope with these difficult situations." 

And the way we get you to do this is by practicing these healthy coping mechanisms so that they can become second-nature to you.

So that you can learn to relax and even accept those negative feelings and not take them personally.

#### Encouraging self-discovery" 

An important thing to note is that what we're truly embarking on is a process of self-discovery.

Which is to say that there are no right or wrong answers with these exercises and that there is merely how you feel in the present moment. 

As a result, observation is an incredibly important aspect of what we're trying to achieve here, because observation is what allows us to engage our brain and think about these feelings and behaviours in a meaningful behaviour.

While awareness is certainly one factor, consciously engaging with our behaviours is equally as important as well.

Otherwise, we aren't truly being aware in a way that is helping us replace our unhealthy coping mechanisms, with more suitable alternatives.
 
#### Helping ourselves" 

At the end of the day, the ultimate aim of NeverFap Deluxe Practices is to help you better understand ourselves.

Currently, we may not even know how to observe our sense, let alone understand what awareness actually is. 

Through these exercises we can learn to better appreciate these aspects of our lives, and furthermore, utilise them as a strategy to help us improve our mental processes.

The aim is to overcome our porn addiction, and there's no better way I know how than through calmness and awareness.




# What Is NeverFap Deluxe?
 2019-05-01







NeverFap Deluxe is a comprehensive method of overcoming porn addiction.

It is the easiest and most effective method I know, based on my own experiences with overcoming porn addiction over the past five years.


#### I would describe NeverFap as a system which is designed to provide you with control." 


Control over your mind. Control over your actions. Control over your thoughts. Control over your feelings and emotions.

Now, chances are that none of this is new to you. 

Chances are that you have been attempting self-control in some form or another for a while now, however it just hasn't quite worked out.

Maybe your porn cravings still get the best of you. Maybe you feel as if you don't even have control over your mood and emotions.

Maybe you've completely normalised all these feelings and you don't believe that self-control is even possible.


#### Well, chances are that you've been doing it wrong this whole time." 


Certainly, I was doing it completely wrong for the first five years of my porn recovery and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

We all learn differently. We all have different life experiences. 

That's just how humans are.

The thing to understand about self-control is that it's completely counter-intuitive.

It's counter-intuitive in the sense that since you don't have self-control, everything that you currently know has no relation to helping you understand self-control.

Porn addicts don't know about self-control.

Porn addicts know about being addicted to porn, because that's what they are.

It's what they live on a daily basis. It's how they understand and relate to the world around them.


#### So there's a few steps we must take in order to address this."


For starters, we need to learn self-control from someone who knows how.

Which is easier said than done, because this then requires a change in attitude which you may not be used to.

For example, in order to learn something from someone this entails both trust and commitment.

Two things which porn addicts generally don't have. 

Porn addicts are generally skeptics and can barely commit to anything, since they don't already have control over their emotions.

In part because they over-rely on their emotions, which change in an instant from "I can do this!" to "Man, I really need to watch porn".


#### So what hope is there?" 


Well, it can help to understand that no one is expecting you to beat this thing within a day.

Overcoming porn addiction is the kind of thing which may take you years to understand.

What the NeverFap method does is start you with small commitments, so that you can more easily work up to larger ones. 

A key thing to understand is that learning self-control, and really anything for that matter, isn't driven by goals and expectations. 

Learning is driven by the small things you do each day to practice it.


#### Instead, the problem is that you're spending so much time fighting these goals and expectations." 


That you don't feel motivated, nor even comfortable committing to these practices, due to fear, doubt and a whole trope of negative emotions.

And you're fighting these goals and expectations, why?

Well, as I said earlier. 

Self-control is counter-intuitive for those addicted to porn. 

Often the reason why we've set these goals and expectations in the first place, is because that is what we understand will help us move forward.

Chances are that this is what we learnt as kids, or perhaps it is all we have ever known.

Again, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. 

We're not here to judge, nor condemn. We're here to learn and become better people.

In order to address this, the NeverFap method takes a strong focus on practicing meditation.

Put simply.


#### Meditation is the easiest and most effective way that I know how to develop self-control." 


The primary skill we will be learning in regards to meditation is observation. 

If I had to describe the most important skill you can learn to help you overcome your porn addiction, I would say that observation is that skill.

Observation truly encompasses the default state of mind that you should be in almost all of the time.


And furthermore, developing observation is easy.

From there you can learn more about the various ways in which teach you self-control through meditation and various perspective exercises.



# Is It Okay To Orgasm If You Have A Porn Addiction?
 2019-05-12


You may be wondering:


#### \"Is it okay to orgasm if you have a porn addiction?\"" 


Whenever asking these kinds of questions, it can always help to come back to The Five Principles Of NeverFap.

And this particular question primarily relates to <u>Struggle over none</u> and how orgasming affects our ability to overcome porn addiction.

Personally speaking I do not think it's okay to orgasm if you have a porn addiction and I've even taught myself not to orgasm during sex, so it's a guiding principle I take quite seriously.

Essentially, the reason why I don't orgasm is quite simple.


#### The act of orgasming messes with your emotions." 


At the end of the day, I don't particularly care about the philosophical, nor even the moral arguments behind watching porn, nor even abstaining from it. 

Ultimately I'm a processes kind of guy, which means I care solely about the easiest and most efficient way to achieve something.

So with this in mind, orgasming simply makes it harder to overcome porn addiction, whether it's to porn or not.

Whenever you orgasm you still experience that intense dopamine rush which more-or-less makes regulating your emotions impossible.

And as I state on this website, 5% of your time should be spent practicing Healthy Coping Mechanisms, while the other 95% of your time should be spent remaining calm and relaxed. 


#### Certainly, it's incredibly difficult to remain calm and relaxed after an orgasm." 


Especially if you've been abstaining for weeks on end, as well as avoiding any kind of stimulus.

It will hit you like a train, and your emotions will suffer big time.

It's the same reason why you also shouldn't binge eat carbs or take copious amounts of drugs on a daily basis.

It makes it incredibly difficult to regulate your emotions in regards to the dopamine response that ensues.

Orgasming, something which produces an excessive amount of dopamine - really is no different.

You can sell it however you want as something that's inherently "natural" or "porn-free" and therefore okay.

However so was excessive war and smoking at one point in human history, so I don't think these kinds of personal expectations based on the standards of society are valid.

At the end of the day, you're going to have a much easier time overcoming your porn addiction by refraining from these behaviours in general.

What <u>Struggle over none</u> describes is that everything we do should make overcoming our porn addiction easier, not harder.

Furthermore, there's no reason at all why you should ever need to orgasm, even during sex. 

What NeverFap Deluxe is about instead, is developing control over your mind so that you have freedom over your life.

So you don't feel as if you need to use porn, orgasm or masturbation as a form of release or self-expression.

You can simply be thriving and happy, just the way you are.



# The Easiest Way To Not Take Our Emotions Personally
 2019-04-03


There are times when our emotions can feel unmanagable. 

For example, we may be feeling intensely anxious about a date we have planned for that night, or we may even be feeling trapped and under the pressure to perform well at school or in our jobs.

All situations which pique our urge to masturbate or watch porn, to a point where we can't help but feel as if we have no choice but to give in.

Ultimately, when we lose control over our emotions, we lose control over our ability to act effectively and it's these situations where we can begin to spiral down the path of relapse and helplessness.


#### All situations where we collapse because we decide to give into our emotions and take them personally." 

And this really signifies the importance of why we shouldn't take our emotions personally.

Not only in order to be effective with our emotions, however also because these situations are inevitably going to arise in the early stages of our recovery.

Therefore, shouldn't be used as an excuse or perceived barrier to our recovery, when it's something literally everyone goes through.

For many of us, being unable to effectively manage our emotions forms part of the reason why we're still addicted to porn. 

In fact, learning to be able to effectively manage our emotions is usually the first hurdle most of us face when it comes to addressing our porn addiction.

We have a craving, we hesitate, we attempt to postpone it (usually unsuccessfully), and then we eventually give in.


#### It's where many of us are stuck mentally, and that's why I'm here to help." 


I want to start off by saying that learning not to take your emotions personally is actually a super simple process once you understand the dynamics of how we take things personally.

Certainly, the first thing to understand about taking something personally is that it's often a subconscious response.

Which is to say that it usually manifests itself as an instant emotional reaction, rather than as part of an informed decision we've made prior to the emotion reaction.

Otherwise we simply wouldn't bother with the drama, and we'd avoid wasting all our energy getting worked up.

Yet because we're largely not aware of our own behaviours which cause us to reach this point, we end up going down a dangerous path where we lose control over our emotions.

Often because we've simply never been taught otherwise.


#### So what typically happens when we feel uncomfortable with our emotions, is that we try to assume control over them." 


Mentally on some level we think:

**"If I can force guilt or negativity onto myself, then I might be able to push myself to react differently."** 

or 

**"If I try really hard to distract myself, then I'll forget about these feelings and they won't be able to affect me."**

Essentially, we attempt to manipulate ourselves in the hope that it will help us achieve a positive end result.

A common example of this (in the case of anxiety, for example) is to talk ourselves up as a form of motivation. 

**"I can do it! There's no reason to feel sad at all!"**

We tell ourselves that we're smart, confident and in control - even though deep-down inside, our feelings are telling us otherwise.

And so rather than making us feel better, it ends up making us feel worse about ourselves.

In other cases, this can even manifest from anger and frustration: 

**"F*ck you PMO! I will conquer you!"**

And the funny thing, is that none of these strategies work. In the end, it merely exhausts us as deep-down inside it's not what we actually believe about ourselves.

So here's what we're going to do.


#### Instead, we're going to refrain entirely." 


And refraining from our emotions is the simplest way we can learn not take our emotions personally.

I'm sure it's not the million dollar answer you were looking forward, however it is the correct approach in terms of learning to develop control over our minds.

Ultimately, there are no cheap hacks. 

There are good practices and your commitment to them through practice and consistency.

So to reiterate, the easiest way to deal with your emotions is to refrain from interacting with them.

Now, where a lot of confusion comes from is this idea of what "refraining" truly means. 

For example, some people misconstrue it for meaning "distraction". 

So in the case of being anxious, going and watching a calming YouTube video to cope with your difficult emotions.

Now it's important that we really think about this. 


#### Because going and watching a calming YouTube video is actually a form of reaction." 


It's you reacting to your anxiety by indirectly finding an activity to preoccupy you from thinking about it.

This directly contradicts this idea of refraining, which instead means to remain calm and relaxed in the face of these emotions.

Which often means sitting there and choosing to consciously relax and engage in meditation, rather than find something to do to change what you're currently feeling.

In layman's terms, refraining from taking your emotions personally is a bit like saying, "Thank you, but no thank you." to your emotions. 

It's a form of acknowledgement where you recognise that you're in control, without allow them to have power over you.

Because when you react, you actually give that train of thought power. 

When you react what you're mentally communicating is.


#### \"Yes, these feelings are valid and now I am going to address them and respond to them\"." 


Which is the opposite what we're trying to achieve with refraining from reaction at all.

Now, while we've covered a lot of theory in regards to refraining and why we shouldn't take things personally, actually practicing this is a different story.

Essentially, in order to refrain effectively we must develop our skills of conscious awareness.

The reason why this is important is that it will allow us to identify situations where we take our emotions personally, and instead learn to change those behaviours.

And the only way we can develop our conscious awareness is by practicing awareness on a daily basis.

We provide a variety of awareness exercises via the NeverFap Deluxe Practices section.

Then, you'l have a much easier time learning not to take your own emotions personally.

As well as remain calm in the face of emotional uncertainty.




# What Does It Mean To Relapse?
 2019-06-28


I get this question a lot.

People will come to me asking if producing pre-cum, edging or experiencing a wet dream constitutes as relapse.

And it's a question which always produces the same two counter questions:


#### What is your definition of relapse and how does that help you develop Healthy Coping Mechanisms?" 


At the end of the day, whatever definition we have of relapse is pointless, because it has nothing to do with developing Healthy Coping Mechanisms.

As I state on the website, anything which doesn't help you develop Healthy Coping Mechanisms is an Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms, and this is no different.

In fact, even thinking about this question is an Unhealthy Coping Mechanism within itself, because it detracts from focusing on meaningful change.

Far too often people will end up worrying about all these small details which don't particular matter when it comes to improving our mental health or developing our capacity for awareness.

Which is to say that focusing on this question of "What is relapse?" is one of the most helpless things you can spend your mental energy doing.

And yet people will spend hours obsessing over it, as if it's actually going to help them in some meaningful way.

(although don't worry, because I used to do it too)

The reason why I think it's so infectious as an ideology is because worrying about relapse is more than just a bad habit. 

It's a way of thinking.

And when you think in terms of trying to define failure, you're inherently going to fight these limitations with everything you do.

Without actually empowering you to learn and move forward.

Regardless, if you want a very concrete definition of what I personally think relapse is within the context of NeverFap Deluxe.


#### Relapse is anything which doesn't help you develop control over your mind." 


I don't care if it's edging. Googling "safe" images of women. Slightly touching your appendage. Hell, even hesitating to make a simple decision such as what you're going to wear for that day.

Anything which hinders or contradicts your ability to develop control over your feelings and emotions is what I personally would define as relapse.

Of course, I think the reason why this whole concept of relapse has become such a huge concern is because of this idea of your "PMO streak".

Whereby you count the days since your last "relapse" and that somehow validates your progress.

And my gosh, I couldn't even begin to tell you how destructive this philosophy is as a coping strategy.

It's possibly one of the worst inventions to have ever been conceived in regards to any kind of addiction recovery, and it's one of the primary reasons why so many people are struggling today with their recovery.


#### And yet people swear by it, in part because it's literally all they know." 


They see others do and so it's created this knock-on effect of bad practice.

Essentially, people maintain these "streaks" which therefore necessitates the need to define some measure of relapse, in order to keep "accountable".

How it keeps people accountable is completely beyond me, because your streak in no way actually reflects the state of your mental health, nor your ability to actually be able to deal with your feelings and emotions.

Regardless, in order to justify this regime people come up with a set of guidelines to gauge their "progress", which is like trusting someone with a gambling problem to provide solid financial advice.

And so inevitably what happens is that we end up willingly change these guidelines to suit our own agenda which inevitably leads to questioning such as:

**"Well, is it relapse if I watch porn and masturbate, but don't end up orgasming?"**

**"Is it relapse if I edge for hours, but not to porn?"**

**"Is it relapse if I peek at porn without touching myself?"**

Like, cmon. Is this really the kind of playing field that we want to promote?

Ultimately, the reason why this whole concept of relapse is ineffective, is because it's an inverse take on the actual process itself.

Rather than creating a dialogue around the Healthy Coping Mechanisms, instead what focusing on relapse does is focus on the opposite which is behaviours which we should avoid.

Which doesn't actually teach us what to do, just how not to remain ineffective without an alternative, which is no better than being  ineffective itself.

I think this is why NoFap and in particular r/NoFap has gone down the drain, because it's constructed this culture of "You have a problem, but we won't tell you how to fix it" and that's just bullshit.

Well, NeverFap Deluxe is here to change that.

Instead, we're going to focus on positive action, positive change and individual empowerment through action. 

This shit ends today.



# What Is Sex Like Post Recovery?
 2019-07-22


This is a bit of a silly question, because the quality of sex you have in life bears no relation to the state of your mental health.

However, it's still a common question I get from people, so I thought I may as well write about it. 

Essentially, it's great.

Like, think of the sex that you imagine you're having while watching porn and masturbating. Well, I can happily say that it's significantly better than that, in almost every way.

And usually it takes around 90+ days to finally get to that point of sensual pleasure.


#### Of course, chances are the reason why you're reading this article is because you personally struggle with sex is some way." 


Maybe you can't get hard. Maybe you can't finish. Maybe you finish too soon. 

Maybe it's even a combination of the above.

While porn can definitely play a huge part in affecting your ability to perform during sex, often the reasons why you're struggling are external to your porn addiction itself. 

For example, if you haven't had much sex at all, you're going to be terrible with it. Like, don't expect to finish the first few times, let alone get hard very easily. You're simply inexperienced. 

Sure, porn makes it worse. But porn isn't the only reason in this scenario.

In a lot of cases it might be because you simply don't have a connection with the person you're having sex with. 

That's also super common as well.


#### Personally for me, the way porn negatively impacted my ability to have sex was due to the false standards of women I'd developed from watching porn." 


It warped my understand of what sex was as this highly visual, dopamine-driven experience, as opposed to this activity of love and connection.

And I suppose that's the biggest thing you'll notice once you fully recover from your porn addiction. 

You'll realise that sex has nothing to do with what the person looks like. It has to do with their presence and the love you feel for that person. 

And as a result, the sex will be a lot of better and certainly, a lot more meaningful. 

Of course, if you're pursuing sex for purposes outside of love and connection, then don't be surprised if it kinda sucks. 

At least that's been my own personal experience, as well as the experience of almost everyone I've talked to.

I think a more interesting side-effect I've noticed from abstaining from porn, masturbation and orgasm overall, is that my desire to have sex has probably decreased. 


#### Not in any inherent way, but because it's simply not my focus in my life." 


Instead, my focus is to help others and self-improve as an individual, and NeverFap Deluxe allows me to do that.

And I think this really signifies the beauty of NeverFap Deluxe as a philosophy in life. 

Essentially, it allows you the freedom to choose how you want to live your life, and how you want to use all that additional energy from abstaining and having proper mental health.

You can use it to pursue women if you want and have a heap of sex. Maybe you're more interested in productivity and business. Really, that's entirely up to you. 

I am merely the guide afterall, and this website and what you're currently reading is a by-product of what you can achieve when you finally have control over your mind.



# What To Do When You're Intensely Craving Porn
 2019-04-24


So, you find yourself in a desperate panic and all you can think about is nutting a big one out?

Well, the response should always be the same, regardless of whether you're intensely craving porn, sitting at home in a calm state, or even completing an intense workout.

As the guide states, calmness is a core tennant of the NeverFap Deluxe Method, which is to say that your job is to always remain calm and relaxed no matter what you're doing. 

If you're always relaxed and in-touch with your emotions, then there is no possible way that you can even begin to experience cravings at all.

And the reason why you're experiencing those cravings to begin with is because you've lost balance in some way i.e. you lost your cool.


#### Put simply, there are no opportunities to experience cravings when you are relaxed." 


A key thing to understand about cravings is that they don't just happen all of a sudden, inspite of the fact that it may often feel like this is the case.

In truth, the path towards developing those cravings were set many hours ago without you consciously realising it.

And that's why I place such a heavy emphasis on developing awareness, because it's one of the most effective methods we have in regards to preventing ourselves from losing balance, so that we can identify these behaviours ahead of time and prevent them from taking place. 

Often it can be an incredibly small decision you made hours ago, which can have serious knock-on effects later down the track.

For example, maybe you decided it would be okay to stay up late to pursue your work or hobbies, only to find yourself in a situation where you're now tired and have no control over your emotions. 

Sometimes it's just a priority thing. Maybe you thought it would be okay to spend just ten minutes more playing video games, only to find yourself stressed out trying to catch up with all your chores. 

There are many different ways we can lose balance, much of it (in most cases) largely obvious to you.

Like, I'm sure you're more than aware that staying up late affects your emotions, or that binge eating affects your energy levels. 

Well, I'm asking you to take it a step further.

I'm asking you to consciously act on this knowledge and stop yourself from making these reckless decisions. 

Because I'm here to tell you that there is no other alternative.

In fact, when it comes down to it, this is all the NeverFap Deluxe Method really is. Replacing Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms with Healthy Coping Mechanisms so that you can achieve balance in life.

A key misunderstanding a lot of people have with awareness is that it somehow gives you "super powers".


#### Like, you just practice your 10 minutes of meditation each day, and that suddenly makes you immune from everything." 


Absolutely incorrect.

Instead, awareness is a tool that is designed to help you make it easier for you to do the hard (but right) thing, of consciously changing your thoughts and behaviours.

There is no "easy way" or "cheap hack" to overcome porn addiction.

At the end of the day, it fundamentally comes down to replacing Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms (such as watching porn) with Healthy Coping Mechanisms (meditation).

With Healthy Coping Mechanisms you can have the most perfect two weeks of feeling as if you're completely invulnerable to the influence of porn.

Only to breakdown into a puddle of mud the moment your mind decides to do a complete 180 and taunt you with your cravings for it. 

If you don't replace the habits, nothing will change.


#### Like most things in life, there's good news and there's bad news." 


The bad news is that once you've experienced an episode, there's very little you can do, because at that point you've already lost balance and you're truly on your own at that point.

Especially if you haven't yet developed the skills to calm down and not take your emotions personally. 

The good news is that there are a million ways we can learn not to lose balance, which means we can prevent ourselves from having those episodes at all.

And this is arguably a much more effective strategy than trying to deal with our problems in a reactive way.

With proper practice and by meditating daily, we can utterly crush this thing and leave your addiction in the dust. 

Please check out the Practices section to learn more. 



# The Biggest Judgement Porn Addicts Make
 2019-03-17


Most porn addicts struggle with judgement, whether judging others or feeling judged themselves.

Certainly, it's part of the reason why we fall into these cycles of watching porn, immediately criticising ourselves for our actions, which then makes us feel worse about ourselves, which then propels us to continue watching porn and continue masturbating in order to feel better.

It's a cycle I'm sure you're more-than familiar with, just as I once was.

This response of self-criticism is one which often runs deep into how we think, as a habit which most people have developed since childhood.

A habit which has become so prominent in our lives, that we simply don't even realise we're doing it much, if any of the time.

Usually because when we make a judgement it can happen so quickly and so automatically.

To a point where we may have even begun to view it as something normal, rather than something harmful that needs to be addressed.

#### Especially, if it's a judgement directed at ourselves." 

Which is to say that we are our own worst critic.

Whether through habits we developed from our parents or perhaps learnt via our own means, self-judgement is arguably one of the most harmful things we do as human beings.

And it's the reason why we find ourselves stuck in these cycles of addiction, as well as feel terrible about ourselves, often for no reason at all.

Essentially, many of us have a habit of telling ourselves off whenever we feel as if we've done something wrong.

**"I shouldn't have stared at that woman."**

**"I shouldn't be feeling this way."**

**"I can't believe I did that."**

All trains of thought which lead to despair, hopelessness and self-harm i.e. watching porn.

Of course, if reacting with judgement is all you know, then it will inherently feel like a natural thing to do, even inspite of reading these words.


#### Well, I'm here to tell you today that it's not natural, and that it's a learnt habit no different to smoking everyday or being abusive towards others." 


It's an aspect of your personality which you have developed, and which you have likely reinforced every single day since you were young.

Which is fine, because through awareness we can change these behaviours for the better.

Certainly, I used to be incredibly self-critical up until my early 20s, but that doesn't mean it's the only way to think about life.

The alternative on the other hand is not to judge, and instead, to refrain from having an opinion.

Which may sound baffling to some, but it's also incredibly sound if you take the time to actually think about it. 

Which is to say that instead of reacting with judgement, the idea is to remain calm at all times.

If not because remaining calm is what allows you to be effective with anything you do, whether it be working on your ambitions or simply being happy within the moment.

So how do you get to this point?

Essentially, by developing your awareness so you can catch those judgements as they happen, and in future prevent yourself from reacting at all.

At first you'll only be able to catch yourself mid-judgement. 

However the longer you practice this, the better you'll be able to catch yourself ahead of time, and eventually the whole process will become so automatic that you won't even have to think about it.

You will simply exist judgement free. 

There's a specific practice which helps target this called **Catch Out Your Judgements** in the practices section of the website. 

I highly recommend checking it out.




# The Most Important Thing Porn Addicts Don't Do
 2019-08-13


It's sort of interesting to observe those who do really well with NeverFap Deluxe, and those who simply don't.

As someone who talks to literally hundreds of porn addicts each week, I've become quite adept at identifying other people's problems.

In large part, because almost all porn addicts share the exact same problems, and once you identify the core problems, you literally become an automated jukebox of sorts.  

And as a guide of sorts, it's my job to try and desperately guide people on what they should be doing, and it can be a frustrating job at times, because although I can literally see what is going on in their mind in vivid detail.

They're often completely oblivious to almost all their own short-comings, in a way that often makes it impossible for me to describe those details in any meaningful way.

It's like, although we're both speaking the same language, that doesn't necessarily translate in a way that another person can adopt in a constructive way.


#### Certainly, this is most prevalent when I talk to people about awareness and in particular, this concept of conscious awareness." 


Part of the problem is that this idea of 'awareness' is such an individual concept that it's almost impossible to truly explain what it is without getting lost in the subjectivity that is our own living experience.

Especially when you're trying to explain these concepts to porn addicts who are inherently delusional, and who are adamantly detached from reality, and who don't believe that there's anything wrong with their own capacity for conscious awareness.

It's part of the reason why addicts will meditate briefly, only to fail to see the value in it because it hasn't clicked in any meaningful way, which leads them to never attempt meditation again.

Without realising that the reason why it didn't click is because they never fully understood how to meditate correctly, nor with the right mindset.

All because they've most likely misunderstood this concept of conscious awareness, and how a practice like meditation interacts with that. 

Which hey, is exactly what I went through with my own journey, so I'm certainly not blaming anyone.

However, it's also part of the reason why I delayed my own porn addiction recovery by a good 5 years, simply because I was too cynical to understand otherwise.

And perhaps if I'd been taught differently, I would have recovered much, much sooner. 

So with all this in mind, what is the biggest mistake that porn addicts make in regards to their porn addiction recovery?


#### The biggest mistake people make is that they don't conscious engage with their minds." 


A key thing to understand about practices such as meditation, is that their sole purpose is to assist you in consciously engage with your mind. 

Sitting there and "committing" to 10 minutes of meditation without truly engaging with your mind, is no better than not meditating at all. 

And certainly, that's what I was doing without realising it. 

My idea of meditation back in the day was simply that you sort of sat there without thinking. 

You know, like to just "empty your mind" and sit there in a state of calm.

Which is a strong part of it, but also completely misses the purpose of it.

Meditation isn't about empty your mind. It's about consciously engaging with your mind in order to empty it. It truly is how you do it which counts.

The reason why it's important to conscious engage your mind is because that's what is going to result in meaningful change. 

So for example, when you experience an urge to watch porn and you're feeling as if you're losing control, you can consciously stop your mind and dissolve that urge in a healthy way.

Because you sitting there and "emptying your thoughts" without consciously engaging your mind as you may have been doing, simply isn't going to cut it when you have an urge. 


#### The idea being that by practicing this activity while our mind is relatively stable, it will help us to actually deal with these difficult situations with ease." 


So to the tough question, how do you consciously engage with your mind? Well, there are a number of exercises in our practices section which deal with this. 

It really is as simple as using your mind in a calculated way without thought. 

Direct your attention. Direct your mind. A good exercise you can do is to simply stare at your hand and look at it and really take notice of the object you're looking at.

Any kind of exercise which directly connects you to reality and to yourself is great for this, especially with your own feelings and emotions.

Ultimately, understand that there is no alternative to using your brain, as you have been designed to do as a human being.

Perhaps you have spent most of your life trying to escape who you are and to keep your mind preoccupied with endless distractions. 

Well, we're here to address that so your mind is king. 

Without a conscious mind you are nothing.



# The Biggest Improvements I've Noticed From My 200+ Day Recovery
 2019-09-10


I find it really hard to write this because I haven't experienced the effects of porn, masturbation and orgasm for so long that it's truly become a distant memory to me.

Largely because I've so routinely stuck to my mental health regime that it's not even something I have to think about. 

I just know what I have to do to get through each day with a positive and healthy mindset, and my thoughts end there. 

Which I suppose is the first thing to note about what happens when you do eventually recover from your porn addiction.


#### It honestly feels as if you were never addicted to porn to begin with." 


For the first time in my life, I've finally come to realise what it means to be this word 'normal'.

Like, truly normal in the sense of feeling like this is what the real 'me' actually feels like.

And unlike what I thought normal would be as this average drudge into adulthood, being normal is actually one of the most exciting and encouraging things I have ever felt in my entire life.

Like, it's the version of me which I've always wanted to be and always dreamed of, but could never quite figure out in any capacity, and it's something which truly needs to be experienced to be understood.


#### In terms of hard benefits there are a few key areas I would like to discuss." 


And before I continue this article, I'd to preface this information with a very important point I've come to discover about porn addiction recovery. 

Put simply, I would argue that most the benefits you receive from no longer being a porn addict are not specific to porn itself.

Instead, I would say most of the benefits simply derive from no longer being an addict, which is inclusive of the mindset and personality of addiction.

So I feel it doesn't really matter if it's porn, alcohol, weed or masturbation - the positive benefits are relative to no longer being an addict, rather than because of the category of addiction itself. 

Of course, that isn't to say that there are positive side-effects which aren't porn specific, however this is my overall assessment. 

In addition, I would like to add that most of these benefits are due to the work I've put into my mental health, rather than because I'm no longer an addict.

While obviously no longer being an addict contributes significantly to my mental health, I would say that the work I've dedicated towards my mental health trumps those efforts. 

Anyway, I digress. I just thought it would be important to point out. 


#### The first thing I'd like to note is the energy increase that I've experienced from no longer masturbating on a daily basis." 


Obviously, in part because orgasm is inherently draining on both a physical and emotion level.

However, I think a large part of it actually has to do no longer feeling those feelings of guilt and shame that came with masturbating daily, often because I was hiding my habit from others.

Not to mention the complete helplessness I would feel in relation to my being unable to control myself, and how that affected me mentally on a daily basis.

This emotional toll is what I believe had the biggest impact on me in terms of how I felt as a human being.

...and to have all of that completely disappear from my life, is like having the world's heaviest weight's taken from my shoulders. It makes me want to cry thinking about it. 

I feel truly free for the first time in my life, and wow. I couldn't possibly describe what that feels like in any coherent way.

I'm focused. I'm in control of my thoughts. Most of all, I'm powerful. I feel so incredibly powerful because I get to dictate how I used my mind, not the other way around.

And that really signifies the biggest benefit from my own personal point of view - I now have the power and energy in order to be able to pursue my ambitions effortlessly.

No more being motivated for a week, only to relapse and therefore affect my overall mood, which also affects my motivation with my career.

I have literally become a machine of productivity. Like, I more-or-less have zero downtime now and you know the best part?

I haven't burnt out.

As someone with bipolar disorder, I used to burn out every 2 - 3 weeks or so, resulting in a few weeks of depression and demotivation and it became this viscious cycle which eventually caused me to give up, as it simply became too unbearable to want to move forward.

Now that I have control over my mind, I really am not joking when I say that I've become a machine.

I can work with full focus, almost permanently and because I'm meditating and maintaining my mental health, there's no overhead.

I have no need to relax. I have no need to 'decompress'. I am motivated and functional like a well-oiled machine.

From an emotional perspective, it's like... everything has become effortless. I'm no longer fighting myself. I'm remaining stable and aware of my thoughts and behaviours.

Like, this is what 'normal' is. I'm functionally normally for the first time and it's so incredibly enabling that it's just mind-blowing when I come to think about it.

Really, that word 'enabling' I feel truly describes how I feel.

I now feel enabled to just be awesome.


Another significant aspect which has changed is the way I view sex and women. In particular, I no longer obsess over sex and I no longer view women as sex objects. 

I mean, sure. I'm still a guy. I still love women. I still want to more-or-less have sex with every womanI see. That's just part of being male.

But it's not something that dominates my mind in any capacity. I have a million other focuses in my mind, like actively wanting to maintain my mental health or focusing on my work. 


#### \"How do I know when I'm fully recovered from porn addiction?\"" 





# Why You May Be Struggling With Your Meditation
 2019-08-04



Today we're going to talk about meditation.

In particular, the ways people struggle with meditation because it turns out I was doing it wrong for years, which arguably set my recovery back ...well, years.

When I started out on my porn recovery journey I was meditating 30 - 40 minutes per day, and ultimately it make zero difference at all to how I was feeling.

Which is why I stopped it for so long, only to return to it with a new-found appreciation, which essentially revolutionised absolutely everything I know about porn addiction recovery today

Of course, part of the reason why I failed to understand meditation was also in part due to severe mental health issues I was dealing with.

However even inspite of those issues the whole concept never really made much sense to me, only that it was something that apparently was good for you.

Like, I never experienced that 'wow' moment where I could actually see and feel the purpose of it.

Well, chances are that you may be experiencing the same thing.

For starters, a lot of NeverFap Deluxe assumes that you have a lot of the rest of your life already sorted.

Like, you're eating healthily, you're exercising frequently, you're working on yourself and you're geniunely motivated to want to do this.

Obviously if you're eating junk food every night, getting stoned on a daily basis or you're abusing yourself in other ways, then meditation alone isn't going to help you significantly.

So here are just some common sense tips which you might find useful.


#### Don't meditate with your eyes closed." 


This is probably the first mistake most people starting out with meditation make.

While meditating with your eyes closed is a perfectly valid way to meditate, I would certainly not recommend it for people starting out with meditation.

Meditation ultimately is about actively engaging your mind and for those new to it, closing your eyes is the perfect way to just fall asleep instead.

Furthermore, it's a lot easier because our vision is what helps us connect with reality, and so to remove that sense makes it incredibly difficult to focus on reality itself.


#### Don't meditate lying down." 

This is another one of those things which people do, which is a HUGE no-no. 

#### Meditation is a form of observation." 

The other issue is that meditation is often explained really poorly to people, even by professionals.

What often happens is that these so-called 'experts' will explain it as 'emptying your mind' or 'focusing without thought' and it's blatantly incorrect.

Well, not incorrect, just incredibly misleading from a processes point of view.

Yes, it is about 'emptying your mind' but that's merely a by-product of having successfully practiced meditation. The issue is that saying what it is doesn't explain how to actually do it.

Instead, it's actually about observing your senses and once you understand that, then everything becomes super easy and you'll find yourself naturally emptying your thoughts without thinking about it.

I've written about the process extensively in this article


#### Meditation is a form of observation." 


#### \"How do I know when I'm fully recovered from porn addiction?\"" 





The purpose of meditation.

The purpose of meditation is quite simple - it's an effective way to help balance you.

And that's really all there is to it. By meditating you can easily maintain balance, which brings a HUGE number of benefits.

This is also why it's usually more benefitial for people to meditate frequently throughout the day, rather than with long 30-40 minute sessions.




# Does Being In A Relationship Help With Overcoming Porn Addiction?
 2019-08-21




People often ask me whether being in a relationship helps with overcoming porn addiction.

In fact, a lot of people are somewhat sold on this idea that they won't be able to overcome their porn addiction unless if they're first in a relationship.

Where they're receiving that love and attention, as well as participating in physical sex on a regular basis.

With a lot of people attempting to give up porn in order to get themselves in a relationship.

I've decided I want to write about this, because the answer varies significantly depending on your point of view and why you've decided to overcome your porn addiction.

Firstly, I want to say that being in a relationship can help with your porn addiction, however how you might it understand.

It begs to state right off the bat that it has absolutely nothing to do with sex. Regular sex has absolutely nothing to do with overcoming porn addiction, and in most instances is actually a detriment to your recovery.

Especially if you're still orgasming during sex.

Rather, a relationship can be helpful in the sense of having someone you're close to, who you're comfortable talking about these issues with, so they can support you through your recovery.

No different to family and friends.

And a key part of making this work is first telling them that you have a problem with porn.

Secondly, I want to say that being in a relationship is by no means at all necessary for you to overcome your porn addiction.

Ultimately, what matters is sticking to your mental health routine of meditation and awareness, as that's what is going to make those physical changes in your mind.

Part of the problem with porn addiction recovery, is that a lot of people are doing it for the wrong reasons.

For example, they're using it in order to try and find a partner.

While there's nothing wrong with seeking a partner, it detracts from the focus of what we're trying to achieve with our porn addiction recovery.

Which is to say that what we're trying to achieve is improved mental health so you can have the opportunity to do whatever you like.

What a lot of people don't understand is that being in a relationship is simply a consequence of having proper mental health, not the goal itself.

Only once you have your mental health down-pat, will your ability to pursue relationships become effortless.


#### In particular, understanding that that nothing is important." 



# My Personal Meditation Routine
 2019-06-20


People seem to be interested in what The Reade&copy; is up to, so I thought I might share my meditation routine with people.

Essentially, I keep it simple.


#### I meditate 10 minutes before bed each night, and that's really all there is to it." 


Furthermore, that's all we really need.

People seem to overcomplicate this whole idea of meditation, and in particular mindfulness, thinking that it's supposed to be this thing we do for 40 minutes each day in order for it to be effective. 

However, I would say that largely defeats the purpose what we're trying to achieve with meditation.

Meditation isn't like physical exercise where the longer you do it, and the more intense your session, the more you'll gain from it.

Instead, meditation can be much more benefitial if you view it as a balancer of sorts, no different to drinking water throughout the day.

Essentially what meditation does is that it grounds you back to your present self, and so doing this frequently throughout the day is more useful than trying to push through longer sessions. 


Essentially there are two things which meditation helps us to 

If I had to recommend more meditation, I would say it's more effective to do short sessions, than long ones.


#### In particular, understanding that that nothing is important." 



# Is Masturbation Healthy?
 2019-08-27


Ultimately, it depends. 

If you're addicted to it, then at that point you do not have a healthy relationship with it and you cannot have a healthy relationship until you've fully recovered.

For me it personally comes down to understanding coping mechanisms.

# The Fallacy Of Willpower
 2019-07-14


I think people abuse and misuse this idea of willpower.

In large part because they completely misunderstand this idea of willpower, well beyond what it actually is. 

In fact, I would go as far as to say that one of the primary reasons why people find themselves stuck in a cycle of relapse is because of the amount of emphasis that place on willpower as a solution to their problems.



#### \"How do I know when I'm fully recovered from porn addiction?\"" 



The fallacy of willpower. 
- I hate it when people preach willpower as a solution to everything.

In particular, this idea that willpower trumps all. Not only is it incorrect, but it sets a false precendence for people, which leads to frustration and relapse. 

The alternative to willpower is technique.

# The Utter Pointlessness Of Maintaining A PMO Streak
 2019-09-23


I've spoken about my opinion on PMO streaks in **What Does It Mean To Relapse** as a largely counter-productive way of viewing your porn addiction recovery. 

Today I would like to elaborate further on why, as it's arguably the reason why 90% of people are failing to get anywhere with their recovery.

It is absolutely toxic and it needs to end today.

As I state on the website, everything you do needs to come back down to developing Healthy Coping Mechanisms and in no way does maintaining a PMO streak do that. 

Therefore, it is an Unhealthy Coping Mechanism because it is merely a distration from meaningful change. 



What's the alternative? If you really want a reference, I would suggest writing down the day you last relapsed, and then forgetting about it. 




Of course, people try to justify it by claiming that maintaining a streak can help motivate you and that it's something to feel proud about. 

Which I don't disagree with, but on the flipside it can also demotivate you significantly if you do end up relapsing.

Although my main criticism is that you can just as easily feel those things without any of the downside.


Addiction recovery is not a game of exclusion. It's a game of active participation and change.

Change which can only come from practice and consistency in all areas of our life.



#### In particular, understanding that that nothing is important." 



# There Are No Super Powers Only Super Actions
 2019-10-24


There's this concept of these "super powers" you gain once you manage to successfully overcome your porn addiction.

Where you die and transcend humanity itself, becoming a god in the midst of mortals. 

In a sense, quite a lot of this is true, yet it's probably not true in the way that you're imagining it, and that's something I would like to explore in this article.

Which may also help you better understand what is required in order to experience these "super powers" as you imagine it.

For starters, let's focus on the parts which aren't true. 

What isn't true is that you suddenly become invulnerable, smart and amazing at life.

And the reason for this is because there's actually quite a lot more that's involved with reaching this point, which is what NeverFap Deluxe is ultimately trying to help you develop during your journey.

Instead, what 



There are no such things as "".


#### Is that everything is fine, until it's not." 



# What It Means To Struggle
 2019-07-28




Today I want you to think about this concept of "struggle".

After all, it's quite a common concept if you're an addict
It could be with your own emotions. It could be with certain people in your life. It could even be with a number of daily tasks you still haven't quite mastered. 

The intention is to identify these pain points, in order to then address them in some meaningful way.

This exercise really signifies the importance of awareness as a tool for change.

Essentially, we cannot meaningfully change if we cannot first identify what may be wrong. 

Furthermore, it's a great way to understand how we think in relation to our perceived problems.

Here's the thing about struggle.


#### Struggle is largely a reflection of how we feel about ourselves, rather than a reflection of the task itself." 


Struggle is a two-sided interaction, in that it's a choice you consciously make.

It's a bit like being stuck in quick sand. You can either choose to struggle with it, which means to fight it and sink further, or you can choose instead to relax and calm down, remaining in place until you can get help.

In essence, the point I'm trying to get at is that struggling is a choice which doesn't help us meet our goals, at least effectively.

You see, the only reason why you think 



In other words, this concept of struggle is nothing more than a perception. 

When we say we struggle to learn advanced mathematical concepts, what we're really saying is that we personally have difficulty with mathematical concepts.

In no way does it reflect on the difficulty, or perhaps even absurdity of mathematics as a subject.

Please keep this in mind as you do this exercise, and really try and explore the thoughts and feelings associated with your personal struggles. 


#### Instructions" 


In this exercise, what you want to do is list all the things that you personally struggle with.

It could be something to do with your porn addiction. It could be related to a perception you have. It could be related to your inherent ability, or lack thereof.

Try to think of all the things you struggle with, and then try to list how those struggles make you feel.

Do they make you feel angry or frustrated? Do they make you feel helpless, perhaps even guilty or jealous?

Again, this is your own personal experience with reality, so how you feel in relation to struggle is entirely personal to you.











# Why Positive Affirmations Dont Work
 2019-08-27


It's funny how what you think you know is correct can actually be blatantly incorrect, and positive affirmations is one of those things.

The important thing to note about our existing coping mechanisms, is that we don't often do them because they work. We often do them because that's all we know, and certainly positive affirmations are one of those coping mechanisms.

Perhaps it's how our parents and friends tried to console us when we're feeling down, or maybe it's simply you've seen other react in regards to helping themselves.

Regardless, I'm here to tell you why positive affirmations don't work well as a coping strategy, as well as what you can do instead in order to cope more effectively.


#### When you take a deeper look into how positive affirmations work, " 



why positive affimrioant don't work - it's a bit like saying that everytime you want to be happy, you need to do ten jumping jacks, eat a candy baar etc. it's absurd



# Your Porn Addiction Is Not Who You Are
 2019-03-24


Most of us probably have a very complex relationship with our addiction.

So much so that we can forget which aspects of our personality may be as a result of our addiction.

Which in most cases, leads to questioning the very fabric of who we think we are.

Am I actually attracted to these extreme fetishes? Are they merely a result of my addiction? Do I actually have severe depression, or are these feelings merely a by-product of my recovery? 

Perhaps you may even question, are the positive and fun aspects of my personality also due to my addiction, and will I lose them if I lose my addiction?

There are so many moving parts to consider when it comes to trying to understand all our thoughts and feelings that it's understandable why some people crumble helplessly in trying to process it all.

In this article I want to address some of these concerns on a high level so you can have a better understanding of what is actually going on.


#### For starters, I want to say that there's nothing wrong with you." 


Sure, you be suffering from some form of mental illness and yes, you are very much an addict - but that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you per-say.

If you can still breathe, if you can still eat, sleep and move your arms and legs - then you are fine. 

The fact that you're alive, conscious and reading this signifies that there is nothing wrong with you.

Which is to say that being an addict isn't the end of the world. It's just a hurdle you're going to have to learn to overcome. 

Essentially, the problem is that you're not functioning effectively because you have an addiction.

And that's really all there is to know about it.


#### Which is also to say that all those aspects which you believe are wrong with you are due to your porn addiction." 


So to go back to our first question, are you actually addicted to those extreme fetishes you watch?

Well for the time being, yes, because you are a porn addict and that's what you've trained your mind to like.

However, what this also means once you overcome your porn addiction, you no longer will be thinking about those fetishes, because you won't be thinking about porn at all. 

Once you begin to realise that most of these problems are due to your addiction to porn, it also provides you with hope that once you overcome your addiction, most of these problems will go away.

Part of the problem with porn addicts is that they can only think in terms of being addict. They can't empathise with what it's like not to be addicted, and so they're completely oblivious to a whole range of potential outcomes.


#### Of course, these outcomes are only possible given one very important aspect that most people overlook." 


That you actively work on your mental health throughout this process of recovery, and commit to your daily routine of meditation.

Because while your porn addiction is the problem, removing that porn addiction from your life is only one-half of the solution.

The other half is replacing those negative behaviours with positive ones so that you're actually living your life to the fullest. 

So to answer the second question, do you have depression or is merely part of the recovery process? 

Well much like the first answer, yes you do have depression, however whether it is part of the recovery process is entirely up to you and how you decide to approach your recovery. 

If you do not actively work on your mental health, nothing will change and you will remain permanently depressed.

Of course, an interesting question people have is, well what about the positive aspects of who I am? Like my quirkiness and dark humour? Are they a result of my addiction and mental health?

In a lot of ways, it is - but it's not a symbionic relationship by any means. 

Which is to say that I'm just as quirky and as fun and as retarded as I was prior to my addiction. 

None of that has changed since I've overcome my addiction. Instead, what's happened is that I've merely gained new abilities to control my mind. 


So in summary, you are not your addiction.

# Dissolve Your Visual Field
 2019-02-03




This exercise is designed to help dissolve your ego.


#### In particular, by getting you actively reinterpret your visual field." 


Before we commence however, we must first come to understand how humans interpret reality.

On a conceptual level, humans relate to the world with language. We use words and symbols in order to define and describe the world around us.

It's what allows us to gauge social situations, learn new theoretical concepts and better understand the relationship between ourselves and our environment.

And yet, although we live in this predefined world of assumptions based on our conceptual understanding of the world.

None of it is actually 'real'.


#### Numbers, for example, are not real. They're just mathematical descriptions." 


On a cultural level, this conceptuality extends to all the predefined rules we have in regards to how we should act and behave.

For example, some cultures prefer kissing as opposed to shaking hands as a way to greet others ...and yet this preference doesn't actually help describe what humans are.

Although society attempts to define us based on our behaviours and how we act, it still doesn't change the fact that we all have five fingers, two eyes and need to be loved.


#### We're all still merely people, after all." 


By the same token, our addiction to porn maintains a very similar same layer of conceptual 'description' which prevents us from truly seeing what we're actually doing.

For example, we can find ourselves drawn to certain types of porn or online fetishes.

Even though, when you think about it, it's all just a bunch of light emanating from our computer screens.

Which when you put it like that, makes porn addiction seem quite silly.


#### I mean, is that arrangement of light and colour on your computer screen really that special enough for you to be completely dependent upon it?" 


Essentially, what we intend to do with this exercise is help your brain distinguish between what you see (i.e. light and colour).

In contrast to that extra layer of conceptuality clouding your vision (i.e. the actual person standing in front of you).

We want to remove this bias from our visual understanding of reality, not only to see a 'clearer' picture of reality, but to better understand what we're actually experiencing.

So really, what we're trying to discover is.


#### What information do we lose with all this additional mental processing?" 


Can we call what we even see with this additional processing 'reality'?

Is it possible to truly 'see' when our minds are in a constant state of evaluation?

These are the questions will be attempting to answer and of course, it can help to understand that there are many ways we cloud our vision with description.

For example, we typically use a variety of objects in our visual field to construct depth. Then, we often evaluate those objects. Are they alive? Are they human? Are they dangerous?

Ultimately, this is the process we are trying to understand.


#### Instructions" 


For this exercise, what we want to do is attempt to treat our visual field as a simple plane of a light and colour. 

No objects. No descriptions. No focusing on certain details over another. No intepretations.

Nuthin'.

Instead, what we want to do is treat our visual field as a non-descript arrangement of light and colour.

It usually helps to imagine everything as a cloud of sensation, although I'm sure there are other more meaningful ways to describe it.

Certainly, don't try to focus. 

Keep your attention wide and merely feel as if you're intaking the visual information around you, rather than from the point of view of you actively perceiving that information.

While you can do this anywhere, I personally find it works best when I have a few minutes alone, where you can really explore this idea uninterupted.



# Focus Your Attention
 2019-01-04




Learning to focus our attention is an important skill.

However, I would also argue that it's quite an advanced skill that should only be attempted once you feel more comfortable being aware in general.

In fact, it's an exercise which builds upon Observe Your Senses so it makes sense to master that first.

Otherwise, we can truly struggle with this exercise, and more often than not when people attempt to learn this exercise first, it almost always leads to more confusion than clarity.

So please do not proceed until you've mastered more fundamental awareness exercises. 

#### What is focus?" 

The funny thing about focus is that it's a bit of a paradox, at least according to conventional wisdom.

A lot of people treat focus as if it's supposed to be this kind of intense period of concentration, which is designed to consume all you energy and attention.

In reality, effective focus is not like that and cannot come from tensing up and trying 'really hard' to get into that mental zone.


#### Instead, effective focus comes from being calm and relaxed with a clear intention in mind." 


I mean, I'm sure anyone could maintain intense focus by trying 'really hard' however it certainly wouldn't be effective in the sense of being in control.

Ultimately, you cannot focus effectively if you're spending all your mental energy on creating an environment in which you feel comfortable to focus.

Because then you're left with significantly less energy to actually focus, and instead it leaves you incredibly vulnerable and quite ironically, without focus.

Definitely, not fun.

As stated earlier, if I had to describe what focus is.


#### I would say that it's nothing more than awareness with a clear intention."  


Which is to say that it's the same thing as being aware in the traditional sense (i.e. observation), only now you're choosing an intention outside of simply being aware of your senses.

This is why I say that you must first learn to master basic awareness before moving onto these kinds of exercises. 

Because it actually requires more skill to remain calm and aware, while also selectively focusing on a certain aspect of your awareness.

Which people generally find more difficult than simply being aware of all their sense.

In essence, it's easier to be fully attuned to all your senses at once without focus, than it is to be fully attuned to just one of your senses

Simply because there's less overhead.


#### Instructions" 


There are essentially two key steps towards performing this exercise.

First, relax and put yourself into a state of unconditional awareness, as per the instructions in Observe Your Senses.

In this state of mind, you should have completely emptied your mind and become fully attuned to your senses.

Then, once you have achieved this, attempt to place your attention on a very particular aspect of your awareness. 

It could be something visual, like a lamp or a door. It could be a sound that is occurring in the background. It could be a physical sensation that you're experiencing in your body. 

Play around with it and see where your mind takes you.











# Slow Down Time
 2019-01-18




This exercise is one of the easiest ways to start building your awareness.


#### Essentially, it involves slowing down your mind so that you can open yourself to the opportunity of being aware." 


One of the most common ways we weaken our ability to be aware is by losing control over our thoughts.

And the reason why we lose control over our thoughts is because they can be almost impossible to track when they're zooming around in our head at a million miles per hour.

In other words, because we're overthinking.

In most cases we don't even realise we're overthinking, because we're so consumed by our thoughts that we don't even allow ourselves the opportunity to realise what's going on.

Which over time can form into an instinctual reaction towards dealing with our negative feelings and emotions.


#### Certainly, for most people, porn addiction is merely a subconscious response." 


And this exercise is designed to help break that cycle.

Rather than attempt to identify and qualify these thoughts, what we're going to do is simply going to focus on the raw process and sensation of thinking.

And in doing so, embrace the physical sensation of what it actually feels like to be in control of our minds, in order to create a strong foundation for being able to control what we think and feel.


#### Because when we're in control of our mind, it's almost as if everything is moving in slow motion." 


The key thing to understand about maintaining control over our minds is that isn't necessarily about being able to react to what's in front of us.

Instead, a large part of maintaining control is about being able to prepare ourselves mentally for the events that will take place in the future.

The idea being that we can then catch ourselves before we begin overthinking, and identify these patterns before they become unmanagable.

Because when our mind is racing at a million miles per hour, it can become incredibly difficult, if not impossible to slow it down.


#### Which is why people inevitably relapse." 


Because at that point, you've already lost control.

By practicing **Slow it down** you will learn how to slow down your mind on a regular basis.

In order to demonstrate control, and create those neural connections in your brain.

In addition, it will help you understand how to become a more calm and collected person, exposing in the process the futility and self-destructiveness of letting our thoughts control us.


#### Instructions" 


When you have a moment, just slow down your mind.

This tends to work best when you're in the middle of doing something, because that's usually when your mind is engaged and requires relaxation.

Keep in mind that there are two different aspects to this exercise:
Mental and physical.

For example, when I'm walking down the street, aside from slowing down my thoughts, I will also sometimes physically slow down, even stopping where I stand.

The idea is to prove control over yourself, even when you have other intentions, such as getting to a destination on time.

An idea that will prove very important in following exercises.









# Blind Attention
 2019-04-07





This is a great exercise in terms of being able to understand what it means to truly focus our minds and train our attention.

Part of the reason why many of us struggle with this idea of focus, is because many of us have this very rigid understanding of what focus is, as a "hardcore" state of mind that is attained in a very specific way.

Usually via intense meditation and awareness study, as well as an almost exquiste sense of self-control over our minds.

Well, I'm here to tell you that it's quite the opposite. 


#### In actual fact, focus and attention are largely conceptual ideas which have no rigid implementation." 


Which is to say that there is no one, nor necessarily correct way to obtain focus. And that all the limitations we perceive about our own ability to focus, are purely self-made.

Certainly, this isn't to say that you may not be struggling with developing focus.

However, it merely indicates that the perceived limitations we have in regards to our inability to focus can be solved with a simple change of mind.

And the way we are going to do this is by playing around with our focus and attention in a unique way.

I would definitely describe it as a fun exercise, which ultimately has you utilising your imagination in order to practice the unlimited number of ways we can develop and utilise focus. 

It will also help introduce you to a way of thinking which has unique applications when it comes to learning, if you so choose to use it.


#### Instructions" 


In order to practice this exercise, you'll first need to pay attention to your surroundings.

For starters, attempt to take note of the various objects within your surrounding area. 

It could be a door. It could be a lamp on your desk. Perhaps even a plant or tree outside.

Now, with this information in mind I want you to place your focus and attention onto one of these objects. 

Noticing this object, I want you to really take note of it's shape, as well as how the object would feel in your hands or what you would do if you had to interact with it. 

Really think about this object and place it at the centre of your conscious attention.


#### Now, with your attention remained on this object, I want you to close your eyes." 


Continuing to pay attention to this object, can you still feel it's presence in spite of the fact that you cannot see it? 

Afterall the object is still there in your mind, and your attention is still on that object as if it were there, visually in front of you.

Now, with your eyes still closed, I now want you to imagine as if you're moving that object around with your mind. 

Perhaps you might want to lift it up and move it to around to your left. Perhaps you might even want to spin it around 180 degrees, and then throw it behind your back.


#### Use your imagination and see what you can do with this object." 


Next, with your eyes still closed, I want you to place your attention on a different object you noticed earlier. 

Do the same thing with this object as you did with the previous object.

Rinse and repeat.

While a lot of this may seem silly, the idea behind this exercise is to help you understand that there is nothing concrete, nor necessarily 'real' about our ability to focus.

At the end of the day, it's purely a self-created construct that is developed through practice (and largely desire).

And that really is what I'm trying to get at here: Focus is nothing more than a skill that's developed through practice, exactly as you have been doing over the past 5 minutes or so.

There's nothing scary, nor mystic about it. 


#### It really is as simple as practicing these exercises on a consistent basis, in order to develop the skill of focus." 


Once you understand this, then it helps you realise not only that we have full-control over our attention.

However that we can develop these simple understandings by changing the way we think about reality. 

It really is that simple.

The same goes for all your urges and negative feelings surrounding your addiction. Much like your focus and attention, these things are entirely malleable and are in no way bound by anything in particular. 

The sooner you realise this, the sooner you'll be able to overcome your addiction without the constant struggle that often comes with fighting our feelings and emotions.

All you have to do is change the way you interpret reality.

By practicing these exercises everyday.










# Focus Your Attention On The Right Side Of Your Vision
 2019-04-28


This is another classic awareness exercise which is short and straight-to-the-point.

It's designed to help you think about something which you ordinarily wouldn't think about, which can help you expand your conscious awareness.

I suppose what I like about this particular variation of awareness exercise, is that it really points out how subtle our focus and attention can be.

While there are much more demanding awareness exercises such as Observe Your Senses this exercise highlights that focus and attention can still be achieved in the day-to-day of our busy lives.

And that's really the beauty of focus and attention. 

As outlined in Blind Attention it can be absolutely anything you want it to be, it simply comes down to your ability to conceptually think about it in everyday situations, and this exercise is designed to help you do that.

So without further ado, let's get to the meat of it.


#### Instructions" 


For this exercise what you want to do is focus your attention on the right side of your vision.

I find this exercise works most effectively while you're in the middle of doing something, because it's not designed to be particularly taxing.

In fact, it's designed to exist as a subtle overlay over your current thinking and daily functioning, as opposed to a dedicated practice you do when you have 10 minutes to yourself.

I tend to find the real benefit of this exercise comes from how we decide to focus on the right side of our vision.

For example, you may want to physically look at something in the right side of your vision. Alternatively, you may decide to simply imagine something appearing in the right side of your vision.

In a lot of cases, it can be as simple as acknowledging that you have a right arm. There's an infinite number of ways you can practice this exercise throughout the day.

Furthermore, another important aspect of this exercise is consistency. Try to see how often and how long you can maintain your attention on the right side of your vision for.

Not to mention, question why you think you've been successful/unsuccessful in doing so.

Do you get distracted when you attempt to focus your attention on the right side of your vision? Do you find it hard placing your focus on anything at all?

Certainly, as with all awareness exercises, the more you practice them the better you'll become at training your mind to think in those terms.








# Identify Points Of Awareness Throughout Your Day
 2019-03-12





This exercise is designed to help you keep on top of your awareness throughout the day.

By becoming more conscious of the events throughout our day, we can become more conscious of the things we do within it.

With this exercise, what we're attempting to do is become conscious of key moments throughout our day. 

<hr class="hrul"/>

- **When we wake up.**
- **When we shower.**
- **When we travel to work.**
- **During our lunch break.**
- **At dinner.**
- **Before bed.**

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

The key thing to understand about awareness is that we're not actually aware unless if we exercise it.

Largely, most of us do all of the things mentioned above, without truly being aware that they're actually happening.

I mean, how many times have you consciously thought about something from the very moment you've woken up?

You know, about a giraffe or that you're well and alive with two wonderful eyes?

Chances are those thoughts have simply never occurred to you, because instead, you go into autopilot mode where you just follow the motions.


#### For this exercise, we want to do is start engaging our brain so that we can have those thoughts at these key moments throughout the day." 


The idea is that once we become more conscious of what's happening throughout our day, it can become a lot easier to detect and stop negative habits from reoccurring. 

In particular, to better address our cravings, as well as those moments associated to our addiction where we feel as if we are not in control. 

And despite this exercise being relatively straight forward, it's an exercise that a lot of people struggle with, because it's a completely different way of engaging with the world.

Becoming aware is not easy when you haven't consciously made an effort in the past to be aware before.

Of course, practice makes perfect.


#### Instructions" 


Essentially this is an exercise of acknowledgement.

Throughout your day, simply acknowledge what's taking place at that time.

For more specificity, you can identify the location, time and what exactly you're doing.

"It's 7am and I'm currently brushing my teeth in the bathroom."

At this point, I want you to focus on how you feel.

Are you feeling tired? Are you feeling neutral? Are you feeling angry?

Regardless of how you feel, the idea is to get you to think about these events and how they relate to your emotions.

The other reason behind doing this, is that by identifying how you feel, it actually allows you to dissociate from your emotions and not take them personally. 

Of course, you don't need to think about. It simply comes naturally.

The end goal here, aside from engaging your awareness, is to acknowledge and not react emotionally.

Because the more you do this, the more you know ahead of time how you will feel, and progressively overtime you will simply feel neutral at these particular time triggers throughout your day. 

This is a truly fantastic exercise that I do everyday and it serves as an amazing anchor for my emotions.

You engage your awareness from the very moment you wake up, and it just gives you such a strong foothold over how you feel throughout the day.










# Take Note Of The Colour Yellow
 2019-05-28


This is another one of those classic awareness exercises where we pay attention to some aspect of our reality.

In this exercise we're going to be paying attention to the colour yellow.

Essentially, I want you to make a mental note any time you see the colour yellow.

It could be as simple as a mere thought. You may even want to stare at it and really gauge it's presence. 

For this particular exercise what we really want to do is gain inspiration from our surroundings and really focus our attention on what is currently taking place within our vision.

It's a relatively simple exercise, yet a highly effective one at engaging with your conscious mind.

Which is a key point to make with all these exercises.

They are designed to teach you to consciously engage with your mind, so that when you're having an urge for example, you can engage with it in a meaningful way.

Rather than flail around as if you have no control over yourself, which simply isn't true. 


#### Instructions" 


That's right kids!

For this exercise what we're going to do is notice the colour yellow.

How you decide to do this is up to you. You can write it down. You can simply acknowledge it in your head.

Furthermore, how do you react when you see the colour yellow? Do you react at all? Is there a particular feeling that this exercise evokes?

Fun Fact: Yellow is apparently the most appealing and memorable colour.









# What Can Your Hand Do?
 2019-05-01




This exercise is designed to help you think outside of the box.

It's not a particularly difficult exercise in the sense that it allows for unlimited creativity. 

However, it's an exercise that's very difficult to master in the traditional sense of being able to consistently replicate the same thing each time.

I find I learn new things each time I try this exercise, and you'll be surprised at the extent to which you'll also discover new things each time you try it too.


#### In this exercise what we'll be doing is coming up with a variety of different ways we can use our hands." 


How we can move them. Arrange them. Touch them.

And in doing so, realise the extent to which we haven't been thinking before, or at least allowed ourselves the opportunity to think previously.

Because although we use our hands everyday, it's not as if we think about them in certain odd ways, such as how we can arrange them into different shapes and patterns.

I suppose it's a lot like when you're walking down a street you're familiar with, and you happen to notice something completely new that's always been there, yet you hadn't noticed up until that very moment. 

By practicing this exercise we can learn to not only think creatively, but also understand that no matter how much we think we know, we don't truly know it all. 

Something which often has to be experienced to be believed, hence this exercise. 


#### Instructions" 


To begin this exercise I want you to first look at your hand. 

What do you see? Take notice of the wrinkles on your knuckles. The hair on your fingers. The tone of your skin.

Already, you're probably doing something unique. Chances are you've never considered staring at your hand for an extended period of time, ever. 

Next try and move your fingers around. See if you can make your hand into weird shapes by moving your fingers into odd positions. 

What happens once you move your wrist as well? Does it feel natural? What is natural?

Once you've played around with that idea, get your other hand involved as well. 

What arrangements/combinations can you create with two hands? What if you interlace all your fingers together? What if you put both the backs of your hands together?

Remember, this truly is an exercise of creativity, so the aim is to play around and see what you can come up with. 

Not only will it help open up your mind, but it will get you thinking about something which you ordinarily wouldn't be thinking about.

No different to your recovery if you're just starting out.










# Where Do You Touch?
 2019-03-30


<b>Where Do You Touch?</b> is another classic awareness exercise which is designed to help you develop focus and attention.

By "classic" I mean it's another variation of the tried-and-true "pay attention to X thing throughout the day" that I'm sure you've seen in abundance on this website.

Well, the reason why I write so many of them is because they're incredibly effective at getting you to think about awareness in a unique way.


#### In essence, because this is what you should be doing with your attention anyway." 


Which is to say that you should be practicing awareness in everything you do, and that this exercise is merely a shortcut to having you eventually do this automatically.

Awareness is important because it's what allows you to understand and learn your own behaviours, not only to change them, but also to enhance them.

By practicing awareness in any capacity, we train our ability to catch ourselves doing silly things, like watching porn when we're feeling stressed.

And instead, consciously decide within that moment, to replace that unhealthy coping mechanism with a healthy coping mechanism instead.

The more we practice this, the more it will help us to think in terms of using our awareness in an empowering way, and eventually it will become second-nature to us. 

Overtime we will become more aware of all our behaviours and quirks, and this is when we will develop full-control over our lives. 


#### Instructions" 


In this exercise we're going to be paying attention to our body and how it interacts with touch.

Essentially, I want you to take note of whenever you're touching something. 

For example, I'm currently using my fingers to tap against this keyboard in order to type these words.

And yet although it's something I spend most my day doing, it's not something I've ever really thought about.

Well, that's precisely the problem we're trying to address. To begin thinking about behaviours which your brain has subconsciously ignored for decades.

For example, your response to masturbate daily as a way to deal with certain feelings and emotions.

In addition, an important aspect of this exercise is to pay attention to the feeling of touch as well.

What does it feel like when you bump into something? Does it hurt when you touch something? Does it feel hot or cold? Does it evoke emotion? 

Only by becoming aware of our senses can we not only learn to better understand how they relate to our conscious experience.

However it can help us to better control the experience itself once we become aware of our behaviours related to touch.









# Where Is Your Knee?
 2019-08-28


This is another one of those classic awareness exercises where we pay attention to some aspect of our reality.

They're classic because you've probably seen them a thousand times before on this website, but the reason I create them is because they're effective.

In this exercise what you're going to be doing is paying attention to the location of your knee.

The idea is nothing remarkable, yet it's an effective way for us to develop control over our mind and expand our capacity for awareness.

I suppose what makes this awareness exercise different to something like **Take Note Of The Colour Yellow** is that the focus of this exercise is on some aspect that is attached to yourself, rather than something which is external to you.

And although it may seem like a small thing, it actually changes quite a lot in terms of your focus.

No longer does it mean seeking that which we see in reality and instead, is more about being aware of some aspect of our physicality. 

Regardless, it's a great way to engage the mind on a conscious level, which is actually incredibly difficult to do.


#### Instructions" 


Throughout the day, I want you to take notice of your knee.

It can be as simple as a brief acknowledgement, or perhaps you may even want to look at your knee for a moment.

I know this exercise can be a bit of a surreal experience for a lot of people, as your knee is something you've probably never thought about before.

What purpose does it serve? Are you grateful that you have a knee? Is it something which deserves the expression of gratitude?

All questions which can help you better understand yourself.

Furthermore, what's important is to observe how you react to the exercise itself. 

Do you get frustrated if you find out that you've forgetten to observe your knee? Do you take it personally?









# Can You Look Through Walls?
 2019-04-14






The idea behind this exercise is to teach you to think of your senses differently.

As humans we're essentially limited by our senses. Which is to say that we can only see, feel and hear as far as our body will allow. 

What this exercise is designed to do is help us imagine what it would be like if our senses were extended.

A large part of the exercises here on NeverFap Deluxe revolve around training ourselves to perceive and understand our senses, and so learning to imagine them is an important part of enhancing that process.

Because when you think about it, our senses really are the rawest indications of not only who we are, but what we know of reality.

So once you understand your senses and truly become comfortable with them, you can learn to develop great control over your mind, as well as cement your ability to remain centred. 

Not only will this exercise help you better understand your existing senses and your perceived limitations of them, however it will help you better project your understandings of reality overall.


#### Instructions" 


For this exercise, what we want to do pretend as if we can see through walls. 

So pick a wall, and pretend as if you can see clearly what is on the other side. 

Now, this truly is a skill within it's own and I encourage you to really play around with this idea of what it means to be able to "see through something".

For example, can you see through multiple walls? If so, can walls ever exist out of principle, if no one can see them?

What does it look like on the other side? Is it clear? Does the fact that because you're looking through something, change the nature of that object?

Is your ability to see through walls a reflection of your eyes, or your mind? Perhaps, is it a reflection of the wall itself? Is it only walls you can see through?

In addition, see if you can imagine different things through that same wall. Perhaps you see a great big ocean, or a vast wide desert. Perhaps it's nothing more than just a single colour.

By playing around with this idea, you can truly explore your senses in a magical way, that will help you not only realise how fantastically fluid they really are.

But also dissolve the self-limiting beliefs you may have about them.









# Focus On Your Finger And Your Background
 2019-05-07


This is a simple exercise most people can benefit from straight-away without too much effort.

Certainly, it was one of the first awareness exercises I learnt when I was starting out with my own mental health journey, and it's one that has stuck with me since.

This exercise involves manipulating your visual field in order to change the depth perception of the objects in front of you, notably your finger and the foreground.

It's a powerful exercise because humans are largely visual creatures, and so to rapidly change our focus so vividly can help us better understand the power which we have over ourselves and our perception of reality.

At a conscious level, we may not realise the extent to which we have control over ourselves and in particular our thoughts, feelings and even senses.

On the other hand, demonstrating first-hand that we do have control over these things aspects of our consciousness is a great way to open our minds and dissolve some of the self-limiting beliefs we may have about what we're capable of as people.

In other words, help us detach from the misconceptions within our own minds, including our ego and all things conceptual.

And the fact that what we're doing here is conscious is really key here, as we're trying to demonstrate power over our mind through our actions.

Because that's ultimately what awareness is all about - learning to use our minds effectively so we no longer allow our subconscious fears and behaviours to control who we are.


#### Instructions" 


While the instructions for this exercise are simple, the real benefit comes from the introspection that comes from practicing this exercise.

No different to any other awareness exercises.

In order to practice this exercise, what you'll want to do is place your hand in front of your face with one finger pointing up.

Essentially, have it far away enough so you can see your finger clearly, but not so close that... I'm sure you get the drift.

Now, what you'll want to do is focus on that finger. Simply focus your vision on that finger, and notice what you see.

If practiced successfully, you should be able to see your finger very clearly. I mean, it is right in front of your face, afterall.

Now, ask yourself a few questions. Are you able to focus on anything else while focusing on your finger? What about the background, are you able to focus on that as well?

Once you've done this for about a minute-or-so, I now want you to focus your attention on something in the background.

It could be a tree. It could be something on you wall. Generally, the further away it is the better this works.

And with your focus shifted, I want you to gauge your change of perspective and truly understand the significance of what you've achieved here.

With your focus on that object in the distance, what do you notice? Are you able to see your finger clearly at all?

Ultimately, this exercise teaches us a few different things.

It teaches us that although we can have two objects in front of us, where we place our attention ultimately dictates what our experience will be.

In addition, it also teaches us the importance that we play as individuals in regards to how we perceive reality.

When we focused on the background, our finger itself didn't change. What changed was our perception of that finger, due to where we placed our attention.

There are also a number of additional lessons we can learn from this exercise, however I'll leave that up to you to explore!













# Stop Absolutely Everything You're Doing
 2019-01-22







I love this exercise.

I can't quite tell if this exercise is an analogue to Slow Down Your Perception Of Time or a percursor to it, however they're both different approaches to the same concept of awareness. 

Usually you'll end up using both in conjunction, but it's arguably easier to learn them as separate, unique skills.

All awareness exercises essentially come down to finding different ways to break down you perception of who you are.

And this is a very important practice because our perception of who we are, isn't actually who we are.

It is merely an identity we carry to help us navigate through life. 

And when we don't realise this, or aren't consciously aware of this label that we prescribe to ourselves on a daily basis, then we can become ransom to this persona.

By learning to understand this identity, we provide ourselves with the opportunity to be able to directly control how we operate, without relying on the expectations of this persona.


#### What this exercise attempts to do is help you better disassociate yourself from this persona." 


The end goal isn't necessarily to completely dissolve this persona.

(Not that there's anything wrong with dissolving it. It's simply impractical for most people, including myself)

However to have the capacity to be able to dissolve it at will, as well keep on top of it when it may be beginning to get out of hand is a wonderful skill to have.

Essentially, what this exercise teaches you is to learn to let go from a physical perspective in the sense of stopping your mind altogether.

I think you'll have fun with this one.


#### Instructions" 


This exercise generally only works while you're doing something.

You could be studying. You could be walking down the street in an attempt to get somewhere. Definitely don't do it mid-conversation.

However during that activity, what you want to do is turn off your mind completely.

Like, just shut it off. 

It can help to pretend as if you're a robot that's just had it's power supply cut off.

One thing to keep in mind is that it's an exercice that's largely conceptual and based on feeling.

So really play around with the character and explore this idea of what it means to shut down like a robot on it's last legs. 

What does shutting down entail? Are there any steps towards shutting down, or is it an instantaneous action? 

What does it feel like to be shut down? Can you feel at all once you've shut down? 

When you've shut down do you feel relaxed or tense? Is this a reflection on your own ability to relax at will?

Play with it and see where it takes you.

...and obviously don't do this while crossing a road.









# Who Is Looking?
 2019-05-20


This is arguably one of the hardest exercises you can practice.

Certainly, it's an exercise that I continue to struggle with and perhaps will never truly understand.

Of course, this isn't to say that it isn't useful as a thought exercise. More that it's an exercise that can tend to produce more anger and frustration, than enlightenment.

Although, that's also part of the challenge. 

This exercise is a bit like asking you to imagine what a cube would look like in 4D. It's not something we can inherently do provided our limited ability to perceive only in 3D.

No matter how we try to think about it, we can provide no meaningful answer that will intuitively make sense based on our 3D understanding of the world.

And part of the magic of this exercise is learning to come to terms with the fact that there is no perfect answer, let alone any coherent answer at all.

This is where you'll discover the most benefit from practicing this exercise.


#### Instructions" 


I want you to think about your mind.

Your mind is what allows you to think, feel and perceive reality.

When we bunch all these things together what we effectively create is our conscious experience.

Now, I want you to ask yourself.

#### Where does your consciousness come from?" 

Does your consciousness come from your mind? Does it come from your eyes? Is there any single point of consciousness you can pin point, in the cloud of sensation that you're currently experiencing?

Furthermore, I want you to attempt to do something profound. I want you to attempt to look at that which is perceiving. 

Which is to say, I want you to try and locate the centre of your consciousness.

What does it look like? Is there even a centre? Is the centre merely temporary? Is there even a consciousness to locate at all?

The difficulty of this exercise derives from the fact that it's incredibly difficult to interpret something you are.

It's a bit like asking someone to describe what they look like, when they've never seen a reflection of themselves in the mirror.

Now to add to the perplexity of the situation, imagine how frustrating it would be trying to describe what you look like, when you've never even seen another human being before? 

That's a bit what this exercise is like, because we only have our own consciousness to relate to, and even then no one quite knows what it is.

So not only does this exercise require an incredible amount of thinking outside of the box, however it's a thought exercise which may not even be possible at all.

Regardless, like all awareness exercises the benefit comes from the process, so play around with the idea and see where it takes you.

Certainly, none of it may make any sense at all, let alone ever. 

However the more you think about the idea, the easier it will become to remove those conceptual barriers and even come to a point of acceptance where this may make sense to you in some form, even if it doesn't directly address all your concerns. 

I highly encourage you stick with it for a few days at least.

And see where it takes you.









# Observe Your Senses
 2019-01-27








This exercise encompasses one of the most fundamental skills in regards to practicing meditation.


#### Your ability to remain aware of your senses in the present moment." 


It's a skill which will form the foundation of almost all the practices on this website, in particular the introspection aspect of these practices i.e. how these exercises make you feel as you practice them.

The interesting thing about this exercise is that despite the inherent simplicity of what it is, it's an exercise most people struggle with.

In part, because of the great amount of misunderstanding and confusion surrounding what 'observation' truly is.

And this happens for a number of reasons.


#### For starters, we severely overcomplicate what it is, thinking it must be so much more than simply paying attention to what we're feeling." 


Instead, we develop this idea that it must be this highly-trained skill that only Bhuddist monks can attain following years of practice in a remote location. 

So what ends up happening is put all this effort and strain into trying to develop this 'zen-like' state of mind, which ends up exhausting us more than it does helping us. 

We become so distracted in the expectation of what observation should be, that we ironically spend all our mental effort judging and feeling pressured, rather than observing at all.

So let's change that.

To put it into the most simple terms I know how.


#### Observation is nothing more than paying attention to your senses." 


If you're at a cafe for example, it means paying attention to the sounds of the people chatting around you, what the atmosphere around you smells like etc.

Because when you think about it, you're already observing reality. 

You're already breathing. You're already blinking. You're already seeing. 

You simply haven't applied that extra step of making yourself aware of all those things which you are currently doing. 

It's literally that simple. 

You don't need to attempt to find something that's not there, nor even manipulate your interpretation of what you're feeling or thinking via thought or judgement.

Instead, it's about noticing your surroundings, thoughts and feelings, in addition to any particular reactions you may be having to those aspects of your reality. Hell, perhaps you're not even thinking or feeling at all? 

That's for you to discover.


#### Where I personally feel a lot of people explaining observation go wrong, is that they focus on this whole \"really try to empty your thoughts\" or \"attempt to refrain from judgement\" mindset." 


Because it essentially implies that you have to do "more" to somehow achieve what is effectively an empty state of mind.

Which doesn't make any sense, and is even contradictory.

You don't have to change anything. Observation isn't about changing anything or setting expectations. It's the exact opposite of that.

Instead, it's about observing what you're currently sensing via your thoughts and emotions. 

So don't worry about trying to prevent your thoughts, or getting frustrating if you can't stop thinking.

That's precisely the problem we're trying to address, and the way we do that is by focusing on the task at hand, which is observation itself.


#### Another important thing to keep in mind is that we're not necessarily attempting to 'achieve' anything with observation." 


Instead, what we're doing is exploring. 

We're exploring how we feel, how we think, as well as discovering what we personally find enjoyable and empowering. 

So that we can better understand ourselves. 


#### Instructions" 


This exercise is outrageously simple.

Observe your senses. 

Observe what you're feeling. Observe what you're thinking. Observe what's around you.

The world is your oyster.


#### Observe all the various interactions that are taking place in your mind." 


It's about sitting there (or standing, or walking, or whatever you happen to be doing) and paying attention to what you're sensing, whether it be thought, emotion or absolutely nothing at all. 

And remember, you're not attempting to change anything here. Instead you're merely keeping note and acknowledging the cloud of sensation that is your reality. 

Certainly, you may struggle with it initially.

Which is to say that you may not be used to simply observing, and instead be in a constant state of reaction and judgement.

That's okay too. It's why we're practicing this exercise, so we can improve and develop these skills.

So don't be alarmed if you find observation to be difficult.

There's always a first for everything.










# Looking Straight Ahead
 2019-06-26




This exercise is truly extraordinary and it's an exercise I try to practice as much as I can when I'm out in public.

The premise behind it is simple, however it's an exercise that a lot of people struggle with.

Essentially with this exercise what we want to do is to always look straight ahead without turning our heads unnecessarily.

Part of the problem when our focus and attention is weak, or even if we've never bother to question otherwise, is that we can find ourselves procrastinating or getting distracted easily.

And this can often be noticed in full-force when we're out in public.

Without proper focus, we can find ourselves staring unnecessarily at every person we walk by (often, to try and seek attractive men/women) or perhaps it might even be looking into the windows of shops.

Well, today we're going to do something about that, and we're going to consciously refraing from staring at others in public.

This is an amazing exercise, especially in regards to developing control over our focus and attention, and by learning to ignore other people in public, you can learn to focus on what's truly important.

Yourself.

Not to mention, humans usually function better when they have a clear goal in mind, and this exercise has been designed to teach you how to focus on your goals in a very simple way.



#### Instructions" 


What you'll want to do is stare straight ahead while you're walking in public (obviously common sense applies here, don't cross the road while doing this etc.)

Focus your vision and attention right in front of you.

As weird as it sounds, it can even help to think or yourself as a train on rails, which can only move in one direction and which doesn't have the capacity to even turn left or right.

The aim of this exercise is to learn not to stare at others, nor have your attention hooked in any way by anything in particular, whether that be people, nature or even store-fronts.

Often what I find helps is if you try and look above people's heads into the far distance, so that even though there may be people in front of them, you're technically not looking at them persay.

Of course, find what personally works for you.

Often what happens, especially if you're a porn addict, is that you'll intentionally go and search around in public looking for attractive people, which merely reinforces our porn addiction and doesn't help us develop control over our minds.

With this exercise, we're going to train ourselves not to do this, by having a higher principle in mind.

Rather than search around, we are instead going to be focus on the journey and our destination instead.

Certainly, this exercise works best if you're in public where there are plenty of people, otherwise it can still work around the house, although to significantly less effect.

Just remember that no matter what, you are 100% in control of your body and you determine where your eyes look.













# Put Yourself In Other People's Shoes
 2019-03-18


This exercise can be inherently difficult. 

In large part because it demands you to think consciously beyond which you may feel comfortable.

In fact, half the reason why you're addicted to porn is because of all the subconscious behaviours you've been constructing over the years, in order to deal with your own feelings of inadequacy etc.

Which meant putting your conscious awareness aside, which has now grown weak and must be retrained again from scratch.

With this exercise what we're going to attempt to do is to try and understand what it's like to be in the shoes of others.

And this kind of empathy is most prominent when we're watching documentaries based on humanitarian crisis or exploitation, where we get to see people struggle first-hand.

Certainly part of the reason why this is easy, as opposed to what you'll be attempting to do, is because you get to hear the stories of those people first-hand.

Instead of these people however, I want you to try and understand the people around you, whether that be your own friends and family, or even random strangers in public.  

At the very least, to observe your own feelings of how you perceive others.

Now, although this may seem like an opportunity to judge, mock and possibly even condemn others, this truly isn't the purpose of the exercise. 

Essentially, it comes down to two different thing: 

**How you genuinely feel about others from their own individual point of view.**

**Observing and questioning the validity of those feelings.**

And the benefits of this exercise are numerous.

Most prominently, attempting to try and understand others is an excellent way to uncover the extent to which we misunderstand ourselves.

Because if you're feeling particularly negative about someone (or possibly positive) then that usually reflects in how we see ourselves.

Which is to say that our empathy is often a reflection of our ability to judge and self-criticise.


#### Instructions" 


For this exercise what we want to do is try and imagine what it's like to be others from their point of view.

This exercise works best when you're in public, usually sitting on public transport where you and the other person are both present.

Obviously, don't go crazy and stare at the other person, but I'm sure you get the idea. 

What can really help with this exercise is to first put all of your feelings and emotions aside, and just imagine a neutral version of yourself. 

Then with this neutral version, imagine the other person being the same as well.

Starting with this blank slate can help immensely, because there's no point jumping to conclusions straight away.

Then once you're in that neutral mindset, you can begin to observe.

Does the other person look tense, or perhaps is it you who's actually tense?

Are they happy, sad or entirely neutral? Does it look like their mind is pre-occupied? How can you possibly know?

How do you personally feel doing this exercise? Do you find it difficult or easy? 

In addition, also realise the extent to which you simply cannot be empathetic. 

What aspects of a person can you not feel? Is it because they're aspects which you struggle to feel yourself? 

Certainly, you may be surprised with what you discover.









# Relax Everything
 2019-02-13






This exercise is incredibly effective, especially for those new to awareness.

I mean, I'd go as far as to say that all exercises are effective. It's just that some exercises a lot simpler to execute than others. 

One thing you'll notice as you trawl this website, is that there are a range of different exercises which all seem quite similar to each other.

This includes Slow Down Time where we attempt to slow down and speed up reality, as well as Stop Absolutely Everything You're Doing where we attempt to shut down our mind completely, as if we've consciously flicked off a switch at the back of our minds.

The idea is that with different perspectives, we can learn to understand ourselves and our conscious experience with a more open mind, as well as embrace different ways of thinking.

So that we can effectively challenge the denial that comes with being an addict.

With **Relax Everything**, what we're essentially trying to do is learn to relax and let go, as opposed to say, consciously manipulate our interpretation of reality or make judgements about how we're feeling.

It's a skill which will allow us to effectively deal with our urges and uncomfortable feelings and emotions.

An important thing to keep in mind with these awareness exercises is that while we're ultimately aiming to develop hard skills, it's also important for us to focus on the introspection aspect of these exercises as well.

In other words, how these different exercises make us feel as we practice them. 

From an introspection point of view, we're not necessarily trying to 'achieve' anything per-say. 

Instead, what we're merely attempting to do is observe and develop our ability to view ourselves with a more open mind.

Essentially, it's a very effective way to learn mastery over your thoughts and emotions. 

So whenever you're doing these kinds of exercises, remember to always try and guage how you feel. Does the exercise make you feel frustrated? Do you think anything at all?

#### If you skip this step, then you'll gain very little from these exercises because you won't be actively engaging your brain." 

And if you don't engage your brain, then you won't engage in physical changes that take place between your neural connections, and subscequently you won't be truly changing in the sense of conscious realisation.

So ask yourself when doing the exercise:

Do you feel more comfortable when you relax? Is there anything you don't like about relaxing? How does it compare to other awareness exercises? Do you even understand what it means to be relaxed at all?

Remember, this is a process of self-discovery.

There are no right or wrong answers. 

There is only what you feel and how you perceive. 


#### Instructions" 


For this exercise, what we want to do is relax and you can do this whenever you want. 

I personally find it's quite effective to engage in this activity while doing something, because it's arguably easier to relax when you're in a non-relaxed state, as opposed to sitting silently in a chair.

So what does it mean to relax?

Well, let's start with some of the physical attributes.

Relaxing from a physical perspective means letting go of all the tension in your body. It means slowing your mental pace, as well as taking things easy.

If I had to describe the essence of relaxation, I would say that it's about experiencing life without obligation or care. You just are. 

It means not worrying about anything, because you know what? There's simply no obligation to worry, because when you are relaxed you have no responsibilty to anything.

Again, I urge you to remember that this is a process of self-discovery, and that I'm not asking you to permanently dissolve into a puddle of jelly. 

These are short bursts of perspective I am asking you to engage in throughout the day, in order to develop a more open mind.

Certainly, while I can describe what relaxation is all day, unless if you actually attempt to practice it, then you simply won't learn what it actually is, nor be able to effectively use it when required.

One key thing to understand about relaxation is that it's a feeling, so if you can't feel it on demand, then you won't be able to cope when you find yourself in a situation where you feel compelled to watch porn or do something equally self-destructive. 

In other words, relaxation is one of the many health coping mechanisms we will be developing in order to help us cope with life in a more effective way.










# Use Your Opposite Hand
 2019-03-22


This exercise is a great way to force yourself out of your comfort zone.

Essentially, the idea behind this exercise is to force limitation upon ourselves and gauge not only how we respond, but how we can better react inspite of our circumstances.

As I've written about extensively, part of what makes NeverFap Deluxe effective is learning to respond effectively in the face of adversity.

It can be easy to get frustrated when we're forced to slow down, or even do something which we're entirely unfamiliar with, but the key thing to understand here is that when we do get frustrated we're essentially fighting with ourselves.

Which is to say that these "limitations" are merely perceptions or expectations we have based in the belief that we deserve better.

It's important that we learn to dissolve these expectations in order to learn to live without these self-percieved limitations.

Not only because they're not real, but also because they truly hinder us in the sense that they do not empower us in any way.

What happens if we get hit by a car and we're no longer able to walk again? What if something does truly happen to our dominant hand and we're no longer able to use it?

This also extends to situations in life which are simply out of our control. It could be the death of a family member. It could be the loss of your job.

And things which due to our beliefs, can cause us to derail and end in self-harm if we choose to react inappropriately i.e. masturbate to porn.

Rather, what's important is that we learn to remain calm and relaxed inspite of what we're experiencing, both with and without limitations.

In other words, this exercise can be thought of as a test to train us to deal with difficult situations.

As well as help us better appreciate the difficulty of unfamiliarity of being limited in some way, not as an obstacle, but as an opportunity to learn, develop and grow as individuals.


#### Instructions" 


For this exercise what we essentially want to do is utilise our less-dominant hand to complete everyday tasks.

It could be brushing your teeth. It could be washing the dishes. It could be writing. It could be using your phone.

It could be any number of things and I want you to take note of a few things which will help you get the most out of this exercise.

For starters, I want you to notice the physical feeling of using your non-dominant hand. What does it feel like to use your other hand in ways you've probably never used before?

Does it feel unnatural? Does it feel slightly unreal? Is the task just as easy to complete with your non-dominant hand? In what ways does it feel similar? It what ways do you have less control?

Next, I want you to focus on how it makes you feel emotionally.

Do you feel any less capable as a human being? Does it make you feel "stuck"? Does it make you feel graitude or frustration? Do you feel as if you want to blame yourself?

As always, there are no right or wrong answers when practicing these kinds of exercises. These exercises are merely designed to gauge your response in regards to a complete change of pace.

Ultimately, it's up to you how you choose to respond.

They exist to help you become aware of your thoughts, actions and behaviours, so you can decide to consciously change or replace them if you so desire.

Otherwise, nothing will change and you will continue to repeat the same behaviours time and time again.

Open your mind and the rest will follow.


















# Catch Out Your Judgements
 2019-05-12




This exercise is a great way to help you understand when and why you make judgements throughout the day.

Furthermore, it's a relatively straight-forward exercise, so let's get started! 

First of all, I want to start off by saying that there's nothing necessarily wrong with making judgements. 

What often happens when people do this exercise, is that they freak out at the true extent of which they're being judgemental.

Which ironically enough, causes people to react with even more judgement and that's exactly what we're trying to avoid.

Sure, being excessively judgemental isn't the best thing for your mental health, however negatively reacting to it is equally as counter-productive.



Much like with the **Observe Your Senses** exercise, all we really want to do is acknowledge and observe how our mind works.

We're not trying to change our behaviour, nor condemn it in any way.


#### In fact, the entire purpose of this exercise is to practice our ability to observe." 


And what a lot of people don't know, is that observation itself is what brings about change. 

Not focusing on raw change itself, which usually results in some form of emotional manipulation or judgement - which simply doesn't work as an effective, nor long-term strategy.

Only once we've mastered observation can we then understand the true nature of effective change, which you'll discover the more you practice observation within your own life.

One thing to keep in mind is that if you are the kind of person who generally reacts with judgement, then this will be a tough exercise for you.

In part because it means you're stuck within your own bubble of unconscious judgement, which you may not quite realise.

But that's okay too. 

We all have to start somewhere with addressing certain aspects of our mental health, and this is a great exercise for doing just that.

Furthermore, your struggle merely becomes another reference point for you to observe. Where you can mentally say to yourself: 

**"Ah, so that's what my mind does when I react to a judgement. Duely noted."**


#### Instructions" 


All we want to do with this exercise is catch ourselves and acknowledge when we've made a judgement. 

Now, there's really only one recommended way that you approach this, which is to acknowledge the judgement as I briefly demonstrated above.

**"Ah, so that's what my mind does. Duely noted."**

The idea behind acknowledgement is that we merely want to take note of it, without creating any further judgements.

In essence we want to remain neutral, if not because you should be neutral in all your thoughts anyway.

It's part of what being calm and collected is all about.

In addition, take note of your feelings at the point of judgement. Did you make the judgement because you were feeling angry? Was it because you were feeling depressed?

The reason why this is important is because becoming aware of our feelings is often the easiest way to catch a judgement before it happens.

Essentially, because most judgements produce some sort of feeling in some way, so there's usually a direct correlation between the two.


#### Ultimately, this is an exercise of observation, and observation is the skill we're trying to develop." 


We're not doing this to feel justified that we caught a judgement. (which funnily enough is a judgement within itself)

We're doing this so we can learn to become more aware of ourselves through observation, and really develop this skill so we can continue to remain aware into the future.

And the sooner we can do this, the sooner we can gain control over our porn addiction.








# Every 30 Minutes
 2019-04-20


The idea behind this exercise is to help you develop awareness throughout your day on an interval basis.

Essentially, the intention behind **Every 30 Minutes** is to help keep a constant gauge of what you're doing.

And by doing so, gain a deeper understanding of awareness and routine, in particular of your own life and how you play it out each day.

Routine is a very important part of the recovery process, and this exercise is a way to streamline that process, or at least get you thinking about it in a meaningful way.

In addition, it's a wonderful way to engage your brain, which is really half the battle when it comes to addressing porn addiction.


#### Instructions" 


Essentially, your aim with this exercise is to keep a mental timer every 30 minutes, and to record or even just acknowledge what you're doing within in that moment.

In order for this to be effective, you will not be using an alarm to do this. 

Instead, you will be using your own intuition, and then checking the clock to see what time it is, and whether you should record what you're doing yet. 

The whole idea is that we want to develop this mental timeline ourselves, and the only way we can do this is through practice.

Put simply, an alarm is not a substitute for your own conscious awareness, which is what we are attempting to develop. 

Personally I find it helps to do this exercise starting at a time like 8:00am in order to make it easier to track those 30 minute segment. 

Although, you're free to do whatever interval works best for you. For example, you might want to experiment with hourly intervals instead. 

(although I tend to find the longer the duration, the harder it is for people starting out)

In addition, I want to add that this is can be a real tough one!

Although it sounds easy in practice, humans tend to forget. It's a bit like when we feel distracted during meditation, and we find ourselves thinking about something irrelevant.

Sometimes we can have a hard time maintaining our conscious awareness, however this is precisely why we're practicing this exercise.

So we can focus on what's important.

Our mental health.

# Separate Your Seeing From Your Feeling
 2019-01-12





This is an exercise which porn addicts benefit from greatly, due to the way it changes your visual perception of reality.

So let's get crackin'.

The intention behind a lot of these exercises is to assist you in breaking down what you understand of your mind.

The word "understand" of course, meaning the conglomerate of knowledge you've gained and learned up until now.

Part of the reason why we want to break down your understanding of life and reality, is because what you currently "know" is largely counter-intuitive.


#### You see, what you \"understand\" is part of the reason why you're addicted to porn." 


What you currently "understand" is that you really want to watch porn.

What you "understand" is that you don't have the self-control not to watch porn, and that it's a lot easier if you just relapse and watch porn.

And certainly, there's nothing wrong with that.

I mean, it's what you understand. You can't help what you've been taught up until now, it's all your brain knows.

On the other hand, it's also perfectly fine to change your understanding of reality so that you can allow yourself the opportunity to overcome your own porn addiction.

Which is exactly what this website aims to do.

For today's exercise, what we want to do is break down our visual understanding of reality, and how that relates to our own thoughts and feelings. 

Which is to say that we want to separate our thoughts and feelings from what we're actually seeing in front of us.


#### As human beings, we tend to attach meaning and value to that which we can physically see." 


It could be a trinket that belongs to your family which evokes emotions of pride and belonging.

It could be the sight of a McDonalds in the distance, and the memories that place evokes. It could even be something more conceptual, like a particular scene within a movie. 

And with this exercise we want to learn to separate these two elements, because what we see is not what we feel. 

They are two completely separate elements which we've learnt to associate together, no different to watching porn and all the feelings associated with it.

Both empowering and overwhelmingly negative.

Think of them as being two completely different sensations. The sensation of seeing, and the sensation of feeling. 

So why is this important?

Well, let's look at porn addiction for example.

For porn addicts porn isn't just "two people having sex". Rather, it's a complex relationship which evokes a whole range of feelings and emotions.

Porn is also feeling immense guilt for having relapsed, porn is feeling completely empty and drained on the inside, porn is the shame of lying about our habit to our friends and family.

Yet when you think about it, porn really is nothing more than "two people having sex". 

Sure, it's something that a lot of humans find destructively addictive, but it's hard to deny that from a visual perspective, there really is nothing that awful about it. 

With this in mind, what this exercise attempts to do is help you come to the understand that porn is simply "two people having sex".

And the way we do this is by separating what we feel and what we see into two different categories. 

Because currently we may have developed a habit of jumbling the two together, and not quite realising all the steps our mind makes internal when jumping to the conclusion of "I really want to watch porn".

One thing to notice is that this exercise may seem incredibly similar to Dissolve Your Visual Perception Of Reality.

Both exercises focus on manipulating our visual understanding in some way, however both exercises do completely different things.

**Dissolve Your Visual Perception Of Reality** attempts to completely absolve our understanding of reality, while this exercise attempts to rearrange our understanding of it.


#### Instructions" 


For this exercise, what we want to do is look at some things, and try and figure out the difference between what we're seeing and what we're feeling. 

We can do this sitting down at home, or anywhere really. Observe what you see. Observe what you feel.

It could be a building. It could be another person. I tend to do this exercise using everyday objects, although sentimental objects can work well too. 

Especially objects that we've kept around the house for a while, that you've spent a lot of time with. (for example, it could be a video game console)

Can you distinguish any difference between the object and the feeling? What are those differences? Is there even a difference?

Is there any feeling at all, and are you responsible for creating that feeling or is it the object which is responsible for how you feel

Play around with it. 

Try this exercises in different areas and different places. See if you can discover any common themes. 

The world truly is your oyster ^^










# You Are Present
 2019-09-04


This exercise is really about 


#### Instructions" 










# Challenge Existing Obligations
 2019-06-13


This exercise is incredibly powerful.

It's a very direct and physical way of changing how our minds works and as you'll find, this exercise takes a lot of inspiration from other exercises such as **Stop Absolutely Everything You're Doing** in a more reactive way.

Ultimately, the premise behind this exercise relates to this idea of change, so let's talk about that for a moment.

The interesting thing about change is that people often assume that it's some kind of switch that flicks on in the back of your mind, which sudden propels you into a state of doing and becoming.

Certainly, this kind of attitude culminates from a typical victim mindset, whereby we believe we are not responsible for the outcomes in our life, and instead are victim to our circumstances.

Instead, what we are going to do with this exercise is express change as a fully active and conscious idea which you are 100% fully in control of.

After all, the premise of NeverFap Deluxe is to develop our capacity for conscious awareness, so that we can develop our ability to act inspite of the existing dysfunction which we are trying to address.

And the very thing which we are attempting to address in this exercise is the current obligation you feel not to succeed.

That's correct, your obligation not to succeed. 

When you decide not to meditate, not to follow through on your dreams and not to use your time in a meaningful and productive way, you are giving into your obligation not to succeed. 

Because often the reason why we don't do those things is because we don't feel like doing them. Which is to say that we may feel obliged not to succeed.

Of course, we never frame it like that. Instead, we say that we're too tired to try or that we never had a chance to begin with. 

Which when you put it like that, doesn't seem so harmful. Yet in the bigger picture of your own goals, is nothing more than delaying your success in life. 

So in essence, this exercise is designed to help you change how your mind works and responds in regards to that sense of obligation you feel when you don't feel like being your best self. 

Which is why a lot of people find it very challenging to do, despite of how simple it actually is.


#### Instructions" 

The idea behind this exercise is to challenge our beliefs and pre-conceived notions of what we believe is necessary.

In the previous exercise, what we wanted to do is first identify our obligations.

In this exercise, what we want to do is directly disobey them.

For example, you may feel obliged to read your email at a certain hour, or to check our phone for messages.

What we want to do is not do that.














# Hard routines
 2019-09-13


In this exercise we're going to be taking the initial steps towards developing a routine.



Simply, for routine's sake. 

Often a lot of people have a difficult time figuring out exactly what they want to do in life, so they. 

We are going to develop a hard routine.



This exercise signifies the importance of trying new things.

It's why I recommend it's super helpful to learn new things. It doesn't matter what you're learning. its




A key component to this exercise is truly understanding the nature of actions and consequences. Precisely that all your actions have consequences and that focusing on these actions is a great way to train our mind to.

#### Instructions" 












# Identifying The Feeling Of Obligation
 2019-03-06




Human responsibility is a funny thing.

When we are deemed responsible for something, it can provide us with an incredible amount of incentive and motivation to act in concert with these responsibilities.

For example, if we have a child we have to look after, it can feel as if we've been provided with an insurmountable task whereby we must do absolutely everything within our power to ensure the child remains safe. 

What's funny is that much like everything else in life, responsibilty is merely a feeling.

Which is to say that it is not concrete, merely an expectation you've set yourself.

In essence, the reason why you end up looking after that child is because you feel obliged to do it, not because you necesarily have to in any capacity.

Sure, there are consequences. But there's literally nothing stopping you from walking out the door and never returning. 

And this is important for us to realise, because often we can subconsciously put ourselves into positions where we feel obliged to act, when that may not necessarily make any sense for anyone.

# Expressing Gratitude
 2019-07-01


This exercise is surprisingly effective.

This is the first exercise that I ever started with, and it's an exercise which always ends up flooring me in terms of the impact that it can have in the day-to-day of our conscious awareness.

Not to mention, it helps teach us a few important key things about how our mind works.

For starters, it can help to understand what gratitude is. 

I would personally say that it's equal parts feeling as it is a state-of-mind.

Certainly, while you only notice the feeling of gratitude, I find that it's a lot easier to remain grateful throughout the day with a particular state of mind.

Of course, that's precisely why we're practicing this exercise so you can learn these things for yourself.

Afterall, you may genuinely not know what it means to be grateful, in part because you may have never felt it in any meaningful way.

Certainly, I know I felt the same way about love, even within my own family, and it wasn't until I experienced my first relationship did I finally feel it in any meaningful way.

Although I digress.

For this exercise I want you express gratitude throughout your day.

What does this mean? 

Gratitude is an important part of the human experience.

# Engaging Expression
 2019-06-02


Expression is an important part of the human experience.

It's what allows us to communicate who we are and what we want to the world around us, which is a pretty significant thing when you think about it.

In order to better understand this concept of expression, it's important to understand that expression is an action.

It's a form of doing which is deliberate, and yet many hold a different view as to what we can develop some pretty unrealistic expectations of reality itself.

For example, if you believe expression is passive, you can develop this idea that others should be able to read your mind and understand what you're going through simply by looking at you.

Yet this is not how life works, at all. It works through active communication and so the moral of this story is that unless if you express that something is wrong, others won't be able to help you.

Of course, part of the reason for this is that may be afraid or uncomfortable to express yourself, or you may simply have not expressed yourself frequently in the past.

Well, this exercise aims to address that.

The only way for us to truly understand what expression is, is to actually express ourselves and get ourselves involved with the process of expression.

Furthermore, to discover what expression means to you.

Of course, there's a few principles we want to consider here.

For starters, what we want to practice is an open and honest communication with ourselves.

Because the alternative is dishonest communication, which is just as bad as not communicating at all.

In fact, chances are that you may never done this before, and you might not even know what honest and open communication actually is.

Well, let's find out.


#### Instructions" 


An important thing to note about expression is that it's purely about intention.

When you express yourself, what you're essentially doing is acting with intention.

For example, when you smile you're acting with the intention of being happy. When you cry, you're acting with the intention of being sad.

Now, here's the thing about expression which people seem to overlook or even outright misunderstand.


#### Intention doesn't come as a reaction to something which takes place in life." 


Which is to say that you being sad isn't the reason why you're crying, no different to a happy event not being the reason why you're smiling.

These are merely learnt behaviours which we have develop since childhood.

Rather, your response in regards to these events derives from your intention to feel those things, whether this is happening on a conscious or subconscious level.

In fact, what this truly means is that you have the power to feel whatever intent you desire.

You can be happy right now if you want, just as you can be sad if that is your intention.

In essence, it is your intent of expression of these things which gives you power to feel them.

So for this exercise, what we want to do is practice that intent.

For example, practice being happy for ten minutes.

Ultimately, what's important is paying attention to how you do this, and gauging which actions make you feel which things.

For example, does smiling inherently make you happy? Is expressing the intent of happiness more than just a physical action? Does a mental shift also have to take place?

These are all things which you need to think about and discover for your own, as there are no right or wrong answers to this exercise.

Everyone thinks and feels differently, and it's up to you to discover how you personally operate.

Safe travels, and have fun.













# Fighting Spirit
 2019-07-09



There's a quote that goes something along the lines of "You are your own worst enemy" and this rings particularly true when it comes to porn addiction recovery.

Often we are fighting ourselves on multiple levels, whether it be resistance to meditating and committing to the process or even finding ourselves engaged in judgement and self-criticism.

The core of this exercise really relates to **Struggle over none**

When we're not functioning to the best of our ability, it's because we're fighting ourselves in some way.

In this exercise, we want to identify the key areas in our life where we .

# Catching The Odd Judge Out
 2019-02-28






A lot of people find this exercise super useful, because it can help us identify our biases much easier than trying to identify those biases directly.

It's a great thinking exercise, which makes you realise how well optimised our minds truly are when it comes to filtering information. 

Judgement by function is conditional.

We discover some sort of condition which triggers us to react, either negatively or positively.

For a lot of people, these triggers are aspects of their personality they're completely unaware of. 

Most judgemental people don't even realise they're judgemental, because it's such an ingrained aspect of who they are, that they assume it's all just some continuum of everyday thought.

In these situations, it can be very difficult to actually identify what is judgement and what is not. 

And so the purpose of this exercise is to help you make that distinction, by bringing to your attention the things which you don't feel compelled to be judgemental about. 

Which for a lot people, is a lot simpler than trying to identify the things which they feel passionately judgemental about.

In addition, it can help them understand more about themselves, by merely identifying the things which they don't care about. 


#### Instructions" 


The exercise is simple.

Your task is to think about the things you don't feel judgemental about. 

Things which you couldn't possibly care about, which don't evoke any kind of reaction.

Then once you've identified that thing, ask yourself why? Why doesn't that particular subject evoke a feeling? 

Why are you not attached to that particular subject?

For example, I'm not judgemental about medical surgeons. I have literally zero opinion on medical surgeons. 

Why? Well, I guess because I don't actually know any medical surgeons, and it's simply not a subject which ever enters my conscious. 

The key with this exercise is to progressively try to find subjects which you're not judgemental about, yet may be related to or have something in common with the things you are judgemental about. 

For example, you may feel judgemental about celebrities or politicians, but feel significantly less judgement about popular sporting figures.

Try and discover some common themes. Perhaps you might discover something. Perhaps you might not. 

We're all here to learn more about how our individual minds work.
