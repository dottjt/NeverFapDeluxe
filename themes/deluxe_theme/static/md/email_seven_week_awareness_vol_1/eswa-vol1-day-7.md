## Week 7 - Looking Straight Ahead

Welcome to Week 7 of the 7 Week Awareness Challenge Vol 1.

This week we are going to be practicing an exercise called Looking Straight Ahead which is designed to help you deal with this problem of staring at attractive people in public.

I know it's something a lot of porn addicts (including myself) have strugglde with, and this practice is what personally helped me overcome it.

Like all these exercises, the key here is consistency. If you consistently practice this exercise while you're out in public, you will improve and you will see results. 

For further information on this practice, please visit the Looking Straight Ahead page on the website.

## Script

<!-- INTRO -->

Hello, and welcome to Week 6 of volume 1 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

I created this exercise to help porn addicts with a very specific issue that almost all addicts seem to struggle with universally. Which is that we have an incredibly hard time not staring at people we find attractive in public. 

<!-- CONTEXT - STARING AT WOMEN -->

You know, it's like a hot chick comes along and you can't help but just stare at her, and that's a huge problem.

Only not because it makes us a huge pervert and likely makes them feel incredibly uncomfortable, but it's a huge problem because of how it negatively impacts our mental health, and in particular our abilty to function normally in society.

I know when I used to do this, I wouldn't even look at women as people. Instead, they were just eye-candy for me to discover and soon throw away once I've walked past them. 

And the worst part is that the more you do it, the more it reinforces this behaviour and soon it can feel as if you literally have no choice but to stare at hot people in public, and there can be a great deal of guilt and shame that comes along with this. 

Well, that's in part why I created this exercise, because I actually found a really cool way to teach myself to stop doing this. And it is super simple, and it is something which I would like to share with you today.


<!-- EXERCISE -->

Essentially for this exercise, what we are going to be doing is fixing our attention in front of us, and we are going to be doing this while we walk around in public.

So essentially it means staring straight ahead while you walk, with your attention fixed on an imaginary place or area in front of you.

And the aim of the game is to retain your focus on that one particular area in front of you as you walk. 

Which is to say that no matter what, your job is to fix your attention on that area.
