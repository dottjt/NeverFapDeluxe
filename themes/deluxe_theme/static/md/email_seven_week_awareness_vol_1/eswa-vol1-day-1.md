## Week 1 - Expressing Gratitude

Welcome to Week 1 of the 7 Week Awareness Challenge Vol 1.

This week we are going to be practicing an exercise called Expressing Gratitude which is an awareness exercise which focuses on consciously generating emotion.

Often part of the reason why we struggle with our emotions so much is because we may not know how to express them effectively, and this exercise truly highlights the power of emotion as a driving force for change.

For further information on this practice, please visit the Expressing Gratitude page on the website.

## Script

Hello, and welcome to Week 1 of volume 1 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

In this exercise what we are going to do is focus on the feeling and expression of gratitude in our lives. 

And the reason why we are doing this is because it's such an important skill which a lot of people simply don't realise is even possible.

For a lot of people, this idea of gratitude isn't even something that they think about, but the truth of the matter is that in order to feel grateful in life, you need to actively express gratitude.

Which is to say that it's something which you engage with on a very personal level. 

Fundamentally speaking, it's about identifying the things in life which we hope to express gratitude towards, for example perhaps it's our parents, or maybe it could be employment related, for having a job which allows us to achieve the things that we can in life. 

Well, regardless of what it is, until you truly recognise that gratitude is something which you express, no different to happiness or sadness, then it can be incredibly difficult to actually be grateful for what you have in life.

So in this audio, what I essentially want to do is bring to light, some of the things which you can feel grateful for. 

Because you may not truly realise the extent to which you have to be grateful. 


So for this exercise I want you to relax.

To find yourself in a comfortable position, and I want you to try and I first want you to try and imagine what you think feeling grateful is. Not for anything in particular, but to fully realise gratitude is a feeling, and that it's a feeling you produce. 

Because it's difficult to be grateful, if you have a hard time actually embracing that feeling. 

And it's okay if you're not sure what to feel, nor understand what gratitude necessarily is. But try and feel that which you think is appropriate, at least based on your own understanding.

And with this feeling in mind, I want you to start breathing. 

In and out.

And continuing with this feeling, I want you to feel grateful that you have working lungs. Which help you deliver air to your body, as well as perform any amount of vital functions. 

Lungs which you may never have thought about, but which make your life so much easier. 

Expressing gratitude with each inhale and exhale.

Thanking your lungs for providing you with the capacity to live your life.

And I want you to extend this gratitude to other areas of your body, such as your arms and your legs. Parts which help you move and
