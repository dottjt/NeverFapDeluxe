## Script

Hello, and welcome to Week 4 of Volume 3 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

Feeling is obviously an important part of the human experience, and it's important that we learn to identify all manner of feeling that we interact with.

And a core reason for this is because we as individuals, are solely responsible for the emotions we feel.

And part of the reason why we don't notice this, is 


You see, some of our most powerful emotional responses, isn't necessarily even because of the emotion itself. But it's because of the narrative we have which carries us.
