## Script

Hello, and welcome to Week 1 of volume 3 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

In this exercise we're going to be exploring touch, and it's really important that we come to learn about all our senses, because all these senses are a fundamental part of who we are.

What this means in more practical terms, is that although we may not notice some of these senses at times, or we may only selectively notice them in particular situations, to not fully embrace all our senses all of the time, is actually to disregard a huge portion of the human experience.

Because if you're not engaged with your senses, then it means you're also not truly present with yourself. 

And although it's perfectly fine to not be present with yourself, and maybe you don't really even care about engaging with your senses, in the context of something like porn addiction recovery, it's actually really important.

Because what it's doing is teaching us to have a more controlled, and essentially, healthier relationship with ourselves.

When you think about what porn addiction actually is, fundamentally it's actually a distraction. Which is to say that it's the complete opposite to being present with ourselves. 

In a lot of cases, it's because we actually fear our feelings and emotions. Notice how when we have an urge, often the first reaction is to panic. It's not to calm down and simply dissolve what we're feeling. Instead, we instantly try and mask those unpleasant feelings with even more unpleasant feelings, because that's what people do when they don't feel comfortable with themselves.

So by learning to embrace something, such as our sense of touch. It can actually go an incredibly long way towards bringing us closer to ourselves, so we can be learn to be more present with our actions, feelings and that person who we identify with on the inside.

Ultimately, because on a fundamental level you are your senses.

You are your touch, and your sense of touch, otherwise how else can you feel reality on a physical level, if not for your sense of touch. Our senses are, to put simply, our gateway to experience.

So the way we are going to explore touch over the comming week, is by taking notice of when we touch and how we touch, and how that touch makes us feel.

Afterall, part of the point of our senses is to help us feel something, and if you're struggling to feel, or perhaps even if you struggle to describe that feeling, maybe that's part of the reason why your emotions and feelings make you feel inherently uncomfortable with yourself.

So if you are the kind of person who inherently feels helpless when experiencing an urge, then taking a few steps back, and actually coming to appreciate your senses on a fundamental level, can actually help quite a lot in terms of dissolving the extra layers and narratives that we tell ourselves. In other words, that panic we experience.

Because the truth is, you don't need to do anything. You don't need to react, or feel as if you must take some sort of action in order to defeat what you're feeling. 

Instead, it's actually about learning to let go of this idea, and an easy way to do this is to focus our attention back to our senses. Such as our touch, for example.


So to better understand what this exercise is all about, what I want you to do is to use your dominant hand, and just slowly rub your fingers in the palm of your other hand. 

At first you may not feel much.
