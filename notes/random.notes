Here’s how you develop the NeverFap Deluxe mindset.
- it’s all about focusing on what you can do that day to improve yourself.

Don’t track it. Don’t worry or even think about it. You just improve yourself for the sake of improvement


The benefits are ultimately what you want them to be. The idea is that you're just doing one less pointless thing in your life, so you can direct that energy towards something else.

Tracker - a parody website.

Seriously you are actually insane, please don’t pledge this much money.
