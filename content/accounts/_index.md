Thank you for considering an account with NeverFap Deluxe!

Here's the basic gist of how I've decided to monetise all the hard work that has gone into developing NeverFap Deluxe:


{{< hr3 "All written content on this website will always be FREE." >}}


I want to ensure that all the written information on this website is readily available to everyone.

It is what makes sense to me from a moral perspective.

Instead, what I want to do is create additional materials which can help enhance the written content on this website in various ways.

These different include:


<hr class="hrul"/>

- **Guided audio meditations to help assist you through your practices.**
- **Structured perspective courses utilising the practices on this website.**
- **A web/mobile application to assist you in recording your progress.**
- **Personal one on one coaching sessions.**

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>


All things which can be super helpful, and worth the additional cost if you believe in the value of NeverFap.

But certainly not prohibitive from an information perspective.

Of course, this website is still young and so
