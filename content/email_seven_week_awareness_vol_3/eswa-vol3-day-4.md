## Week 4 - Identifying The Feeling Of Obligation

Welcome to Week 4 of the 7 Week Awareness Challenge Vol 3.



## Script

Hello, and welcome to Week 4 of Volume 3 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

Feeling is obviously an important part of the human experience, and it's important that we learn to identify all manner of feeling that we interact with.

And a core reason for this is because we as individuals, are solely responsible for the emotions we feel. 

In other words, we actually create every single emotion we feel, even though it may not seem like it at the time when we experience these emotions.

And part of the reason why we don't notice this, is 


You see, some of our most powerful emotional responses, isn't necessarily even because of the emotion itself. But it's because of the narrative we have which carries us.
