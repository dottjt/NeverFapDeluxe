Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Awareness Over All course!

Awareness forms the basis of all successful porn recovery outcomes. 

I'm yet to meet a single person who's been able to successfully overcome porn addiction without the use of meditation and other core observation exercises.

You should already be familiar with <a class="link" href="/practices/observe-it-all">Observe it all</a> as part of the Introduction course, which should have been your first taste of the power that meditation can have over your mind.

What the Awareness Over All course does is extend this practice into other areas, so you can understand different ways of practicing calm and feeling comfortable with yourself.

Remember that there are right or wrong ways of being aware. Awareness itself is a very personal understanding based on how you think and feel in the present moment.

Just understand that the more you practice awareness in it's different forms, the more it will make sense to you, and the more control you will have over your mind.

Then at a certain level of awareness, you'll more-or-less feel invulnerable to your own desires and you'll be able to switch what your mind is thinking and feeling within a heartbeat.

Of course, consistent practice is key. You won't get anywhere without your daily commitment to your mental health.
