Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Balance Over Reward course!

If you think about it, all you really have is your mental health.

And it can become almost impossible to maintain our mental health, in particular our porn recovery goals, when our feelings and emotions are completely out of whack.

What Balance Over Reward maintains is that we must place our mental health first, so that we don't find ourselves at a point where we feel like relapsing or everything feels unmanagable.
