Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Choice Over Mind course!

The Choice Over Mind course is the one that I recommend people move onto next having completed the Introduction Course. 

In part because most people find Choice Over Mind to be quite profound in terms of cutting through the cynicism they may have been developed as a porn addict over the years.

Primarily that they are victim to porn addiction, that porn addiction is impossible to overcome, that they can't commit to their mental health, as well as the basic notion of:

Well, truth is that you definitely haven't tried everything, and it's certainly not reflection of your intelligence or your ability to overcome porn addiction.

You simply haven't been taught properly, going all the way back to your childhood where you failed to learn healthy coping mechanisms to deal with your problems. 

Today is when your suffering ends.

NeverFap Deluxe is here to end the needless trial and error you've likely been pursuing up until now, and actually help you get verifiable results and change the way you think as a person.


{{< hr3 "What Choice Over Mind aims to provide you with the insight to understand that you have full-control over your mind, whether you currently realise it or not." >}}


Which is to say that with the right training, you can develop full control over what you feel, think and believe.

Read the articles. Do the practices. Then do them again. 

I honestly don't know how else to tell you this. 

People will literally do absolutely everything but the exercises, and then they wonder why they're getting nowhere with their porn recovery or why they're finding it so hard to commit or deal with their cravings.

Why be that person?
