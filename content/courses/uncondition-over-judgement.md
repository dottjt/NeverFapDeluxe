<!-- Will Require One Edit -->

Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Uncondition Over Judgement course!

I suppose there's two ways to approach developing awareness, and in these series of courses I've decided to take a more fundamental approach than compared to most other resources.

What a lot of self-awareness courses tend to do is ask you to first identify your thoughts and judgements, and then to go about dissolving them once they've been identified.

From a very fundamental point of view and from my own personal experience, I don't believe it's a very effective approach and instead, I've gone down the route of teaching observation and awareness first as a guiding principle.


{{< hr3 "Part of the reason why I've done this is due to the way awareness fundamentally works." >}}


For starters, your ability to develop awareness is irrespective of why you think the way you do, nor what your thoughts even are.

Awareness is simply awareness, and is effective as it's own.

In fact, when you start asking people to first identify their judgements and thoughts, they inherently come to the conclusion that the two things are related - when they have no relation what-so-ever.

Good mental health practices have absolutely nothing to do with bad mental health practices, and taking a deeper understanding into your bad mental health practices isn't going to help improve your ability to perform good mental health practices.

I certainly don't deny that identifying bad practices is a good thing, however people starting out with their mental health rarely stop there.

Regardless, now that we should have developed a strong ability to maintain and practice awareness, now is a good opportunity to begin understanding the other side of the equation:


{{< hr3 "Why we make judgements within the first place and why they are harmful." >}}


Certainly, you should already have developed at least a partial understanding the awareness exercises you've been practicing on a daily basis, which actively ask you to remain calm.

Have you noticed a difference? If so, what is that difference and how does it make you feel?

These are all questions which we will explore throughout this final module.
