Hovering is a meditation technique that I created to assist people who are new to meditation, or perhaps struggle to meditate via traditional means.

It has been designed to be easy to understand, simple to practice, as well as remain acessible to people of all ages.

Unlike traditional meditation, Hovering aims to be highly concrete as opposed to highly abstract so you can have that 'ah-ha' moment of clarity a lot sooner, rather than later.

Because chances are that you may have meditated in the past and you may not have understood exactly what it was you did, let alone what the point of it all was.

Well, Hovering aims to bridge that gap.
