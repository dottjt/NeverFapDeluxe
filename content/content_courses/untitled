- Look at Yichi's Ticket

- Ask Brett: 
	+ Does MyAccount only have access to the Product Instance ID? My understand is that it is currently being stored in your URL. Is there any other information from the user that MyAccount has?

	Essentially we are trying to figure out how best to retrieve information about the user's subscription via the Subscription API, however that only takes the product serial number. Not the product instance ID.

- Ask Jess:
	+ How to get a product instance id from an order id or a serial number.

DOCUMENTATION

- I can confirm that MyAccount only has access to the Product Instance ID (TODO)

- I can confirm that currently the Subscription API only takes the product serial number, and not the PIID.

- Generally this Endpoint should not be used outside of Sales & Billing. It is a low-level API, which means that it may not include the same level of validation or error reporting that Sales & Billing have. Furthermore, it is another point of contact with another team which isn't Sales & Billing. 

- Ideally Sales & Billing should

Essentials 1-to-1 relationship with PIID
ARL - One serial number has multiple PIID

PIID is for internal system use.


It represents a identifier for your 'asset' which really is just a unique way to say the product type you have
4:30
and yes it is unique, but you can have multiple PIID (or CDF GUIDs) that belong to the SN (serial number) (edited)

4:31
One overarching Client ID - has an Asset (serial number) which has one CDF GUID or PIID (edited) 
4:32
SN is a 12 digit number the client uses when they call up support to identify them selves
4:32
its easier than giving them a GUID
4:33
ARL is different as you can have multiple PIID per SN (PIID is really just a business)
