Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Balance Over Reward course!

I want to start by saying that all you really have in life is your mind and your associated mental health. These two things largely determine our quality of life, irrespective of our circumstances in life.

And it can become almost impossible to maintain our mental health when our feelings and emotions are completely out of whack. Especially when we don't respect routines and boundaries.


{{< hr3 "What Balance Over Reward aims to teach is moderation over obsession." >}}


Balance Over Reward maintains is that we must place our mental health first, so we can effortlessly maintain control over our mind. 

On the other hand, when we don't place our mental health first and we instead place our work, our ambition or our obsessions in first place, our whole wellbeing suffers.

Of course, you may already be aware of this.

You may be aware of the fact that an inconsistent sleep routine affects your ability to regulate your emotions, or how overcommitting to work affects your ability to focus and remain calm.

Well, I'm here to tell you to take it seriously. 

Because it's likely a strong part of the reason why you're addicted to porn, and certainly it was something which affected me well-beyond that I thought it did.

This is inspite of the fact that I was exercising regularly, sleeping consistently and doing so many things correctly to maintain my mental and physical health.

It only take a moment of unbalance to topple a person. 

Make balance your priority.
