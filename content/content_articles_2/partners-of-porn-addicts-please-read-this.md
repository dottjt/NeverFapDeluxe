<!-- Still needs to be written. -->

I wanted to write this article to provide closure to people struggling with a partner who may be struggling with porn addiction.

Largely because there's a lot of misconception surrounding what may be actually going on inside their partner's minds, which is often based on incorrect assumptions.

Another thing to point out is that this article will largely be addressed at women, at least conceptually as a write this, since they seem to be the ones most victim to this. 


{{< hr3 "For starters, I can happily say that their porn addiction has absolutely nothing to do with you." >}}


I mean, it does have to do with you in that you happen to be in their life, and you happen to be in a relationship, and perhaps even to the extent which you contribute towards their mental health in various ways (maybe it's an unhappy relationship, for example).

However you are largely external to their addiction.

It's not because of how you look. It's not because you're not "sexy" enough. In fact, you don't even enter the equation, at all. They're not thinking about you, or how you feel.

All they're thinking about is their addiction and how they can fulfil it. You for all intents and purposes do not exist within their world. 

Which obviously can be interpretted in various ways, but it's best you don't try and interpret it at all, and simply try and understand the fundamentals of what are going on.

Ultimately so you don't go down the path of taking it personally, as addiction is not personal. 


{{< hr3 "Remember, you don't fit into the equation, at all." >}}


Which isn't to say that porn addicts don't feel guilt for their actions, nor aren't trying to get better, it's just that they're not inherently thinking about you when they pursue the day-to-day of watching porn and masturbating.

I suppose the point I'm trying to get at is that addiction is a very mechanical process.

There is no reasoning (and furthermore, no amount of reasoning can help). There is no "I wonder how they will feel as a result of my actions". 

It is purely a habit which people find themselves stuck in, and a situation which you happen to find yourself a part of.

So how exactly should you feel and what exactly should you do? 

Well, this is a really hard question to answer, especially since a relationship is an inherently personal thing, but at most I can explain the dynamics of it.


{{< hr3 "The sad truth is that there is ultimately nothing you can do to help them, that they first must be doing themselves." >}}


Which is to say that you can support their current efforts, if they're already working on those efforts to overcome porn addiction.

But in terms of a partner who is in denial about their porn addiction, nothing you do or say can help.

If you try and force it and bring it up, they'll most likely resent you. If you try and introduce mental health practice for the sake of common-good, they'll fail to understand the purpose of it. 

In a lot of cases, often it's not until they lose you will they realise the extent to which they had a problem. 

Certainly, that was the case for me, and it's an ugly truth, but for a lot of people rock-bottom is the only way they're ever learn and change. 

Ultimately, it can help to understand that porn addicts live within their own unapprochable bubble, which can only be dissolved through self-understanding.

Certainly, while I don't disagree that external support can be a fantastic aid, 

Personally speaking, the hardest thing for me as a porn addict was "coming out" about my addiction to my partner.

And that's something you certainly cannot force, at all. 

Although I suppose it comes down to the kind of relationship you have with your partner, and this really is key to the whole process. 

Personally I'm very lucky in that I'm in a relationship with a person where honesty and open communication is valued, which made the whole process of talking about my addiction so much easier.
