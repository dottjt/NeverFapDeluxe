I talk to a lot of people who continually struggle with porn addiction, and they all have one thing in common.

They neglect the basics.

Which is to say they misunderstand or willingly ignore the fundamentals of effective recovery.

And usually it comes down to one of two things. Either they never knew about the fundamentals to begin with, and were simply trying to wing it this entire time.

Perhaps because they never realised that improving their mental health was ever required to address something like addiction.

Or they did end up discovering the basics at some point, only to forget them later down the track.

Either because they grew skeptical as they continued to struggle with their addiction, or because they didn't have the awareness or foresight to maintain a mental health routine.

Actually, there are any number of reasons why we stop pursuing things like Healthy Coping Mechanisms, and that's cool too.

It took me close to 5 years of battling with myself before I began sticking to the schedule, so everyone reacts differently.

In today's post what I essentially want to do is emphasise the importance of the basics of recovery, really as a guiding path forward no matter what which stage you're at.

It doesn't matter if you've already mastered your mind, or if you're just starting out with your journey.

The fundamentals always apply.

In other words, whenever we're struggling with something or we feel as if something isn't working out for us, then it's us that's the issue.

Which is to say that we need to educate ourselves in order to understand how we can apply these fundamentals to our life, rather than dismiss them as something.

I suppose this stems from the idea that I believe everyone has the same capacity/potential for greatness as anyone else.

In the case of porn addiction recovery, there is no difference between you and me in terms of being able to be porn free.

The only difference is that I know how, while you do not.

And it's a difference based not in superiority, but simply on time and effort. As I state on NeverFap Deluxe, it's simply a matter of practice and consistency.
