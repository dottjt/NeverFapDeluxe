<!-- To complete -->

I'm going to begin this article by saying that if you even think there is something to understand about brain rewiring, then you're already misunderstanding this concept of brain rewiring.

Like I've said in the past, porn addiction recovery is not a knowing. No amount of knowing is going to help you overcome porn addiction.

I don't care if it's the fundamentals of how dopamine works, nor even if it's the rational theory of how modern porn hooks us. 

Porn addiction recovery is a hard process and any amount of tinkering or rationalisation, especially with our already addicted brains, can only hope to distort this process.

It's the same reason why you ended up thinking "Well, maybe a little peek wouldn't hurt?" two months into our journey, a defining moment where you then decided to relapse, and immediately regret it afterwards.


{{< hr3 "Well, now you know why. It's because you rationalised." >}}


Today I want to talk about brain rewiring because it's a topic which a lot of people end up rationalising, which leads to all sorts of fears and doubts about their recovery.

Common rationalisations related to brain rewiring include:


**"It's been 2 weeks and I don't feel any different, is this really worth it?"**

**"If I relapse how far does that set me back?"**


And it's silly, because it does absolutely nothing to help us actually move forward and honor the process.

Which is to say that rationalisation is not based in principle and arguably the reason why people rationalise in the first place is because they don't have hard principles to begin with.

For example, choosing not to rationalise under any circumstances is a hard principle. Learning to remain calm in all situations is a hard principle. 

And when we don't have these rules in place, we leave our actions to chance because we automatically assume as if our intuition knows better.

Well, it doesn't. That's why you're an addict.

Essentially the point I'm coming to is that in order to properly move forward, it means that we need to develop a set of hard principles surrounding this idea of recovery progress.

Especially in regards to brain rewiring, since that is largely what recovery is on a fundamental level.


{{< hr3 "The first principle is that your brain is always rewiring." >}}


In other words, don't worry and especially don't worry about how you're feeling.

It doesn't matter if you're having a terrible day where you're really struggling with your addiction, or an amazing day where your mind is as clear as Persian glass.

Your brain is always rewiring to your actions.

It can help to think of change in terms of input and output, and the brain as a machine which processes this. The less unhelpful stuff you input, the less unhelpful stuff you'll output. 

You doubting the process and worry about it is you inputting unhelpful stuff into your brain. It goes directly against the process. 

The sooner you stop the rationalisation, the easier it will get. 


{{< hr3 "The second principle is that refraining is effective" >}}


This is why learning to refrain from reaction and learning to remain calm is such an important part of the porn addiction recovery process, because it's really about learning to input less unhelpful stuff into our brains.

The problem is that people view this as being ineffective.
