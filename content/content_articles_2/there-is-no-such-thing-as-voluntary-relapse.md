Relapse by definition is never voluntary.

Saying it is voluntary is essentially saying that


A lot of people try to justify their behaviour through rationalisation.

They assume that if they're able to come up with a reason, it can therefore provide some sort of insight.

And it's an attitude which people apply not only to their recovery, but their entire lives in general.

It's how people get away with procrastinating for hours at a time, opposed to commit to the schedule that they initially created for themselves.

Perhaps the worst form of rationalisation is when people try and add perspective to their actions,

I suppose the primary problem is that none of it is real.

Which is to say that all your rationalisations are purely fabricated and literally have no meaning what-so-ever.

Rather, it can help to think of rationalisation as nothing more than a mental pattern that you're adopted and reinforced since birth.

There are no "reasons" why you relapsed, so much that you physically masturbated to porn.

Coming with reasons why you may have masturbated to porn isn't going to help you stop masturbing to porn. In fact, it's merely going to distract you.

What's going to help you overcome these behaviours is to learn new behaviours instead, such as learning not to rationalise and instead learn to refrain from reacting and learning to remain calm and collected instead.
