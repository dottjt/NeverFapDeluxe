What makes recovery easy?


The truth is that recovery can be easy.

In fact, I would argue that recovery needs to be easy by definition, otherwise we simply get caught up in our feelings and emotions and we end up relapsing time and time again.

It's part of what I want to achieve with NeverFap Deluxe, to provide people with a process of recovery that will work for a majority of people.

Simply due to the fact that it's simple and straight forward.

As in like, easy to a point where you no longer have to think or even worry about it, because you'll have that ability to simply understand exactly what's required of you without ambiguity?

Well, it all comes down to truly understanding this idea of balance.

Balance is ultimately what we're working towards and is what our daily routine of meditation and mental health aims to maintain.

A large part of the reason why people struggle with their porn addiction is because they either disrespect or they misunderstand this concept of balance.

Especially people who think they're above balance as a principle.

For example, choosing to stay up late instead of going to bed early.
