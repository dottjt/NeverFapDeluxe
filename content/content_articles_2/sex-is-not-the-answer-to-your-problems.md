<!-- To finish, incomplete -->

When you become addicted to porn for long enough, you can come up with all sorts of reasons as to why you're addicted.

Of course, the funny thing is that you never started watching porn with these reasons in mind.

You simply remained addicted and irrational for so long that you forgot that your addicted started out as a behaviour which you enjoyed, which eventually turned into a habit and then ultimately became an obsession.

With this in mind, one of the most common ways people try to justify their porn addiction is by saying that it's because they can't readily have sex.

Either due to religious reasons, or because they feel as if they're ugly and therefore will never find a partner to have sex with, so you know, what's even the point of trying?


{{< hr3 "Here's the deal, none of this is actually true." >}}


You pursuing porn has nothing to do with the rationalisations you come up with, in anyway.

They're just rationalisations you came with, which anyone can fabricate with a high degree of conviction, which in no way reflects your porn addiction.

The reason why they don't reflect your condition is because porn addiction doesn't operate on rationalisations. It doesn't care what your rationalisations are.

Instead, your porn operates on behaviours which you have reinforced on a daily basis.

Your brain doesn't think "Oh wow, I'm worthless and can't get sex, therefore I should watch porn today".

It just goes and watches porn because that's what it's been wired to do.

The sooner you come to realise that porn addiction is nothing more than a literal habit, the quicker you'll be able to move past the destructive cycle that is thinking your rationalisations mean something, when they very clearly don't.


{{< hr3 "It's part of the reason why people get trapped in the cycle of guilt and feeling as if they're not good enough." >}}


It's because people get caught up in these rationalisations, which distracts them from their feelings and emotions which are actually pulling the strings from behind the scenes.

It doesn't work for the reason that saying "Man, I'm so disgusted by porn, I'm never going to do it again" makes no difference to your recovery what-so-ever.

It's because being addicted to porn (and subscequently, recovering from porn addiction) has nothing to do with the expectations you have or yourself or your reasons for motivation.

If it were that simple, none of us would be addicted to porn in the first place. So really, it's about learning to think outside of the box and identifying our habits and behaviours so we can change them on a fundamental level.

Rather than get caught up in a list of whys; an ever-evolving list which changes depending on how we're feeling for that day.

With that said, there are a few reasons why people buy into this whole "because I'm not getting laid" thing.


For starters, it's a logically consistent argument to make. It's hard to deny the logical link between porn addiction and sex, in part because it's almost impossible to improve.

And porn addicts thrive on misconception.

A lot of porn addicts start young, and when you're young, addicted to porn and you've never had sex before - it's easy to think that sex might be the answer.

Furthermore, once they do have sex and realise



The other reason has less to do with sex itself,

A key thing to understand is that although the rationalisations themselves are meaningless, this isn't to say that the attitudes are not.

Which is to say that what is real is the hopelessness and cynicism which we are experiencing on the inside which is driving us to rationalise our behaviour.

Much like porn addiction, things like cynicism and judgement are also learnt behaviours and when you

Attitudes which have been developed as a result of excessive porn use.
