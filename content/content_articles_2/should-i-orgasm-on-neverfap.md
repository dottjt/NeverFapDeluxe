Should I orgasm on NeverFap?


When considering such questions it can help to try and undesrtand what NeverFap Deluxe is really all about.

At it's core NeverFap Deluxe is about helping you develop control over your mind through the use of Healthy Coping Mechanisms such as Meditation and awareness exercises.

And the ultimate aim of having control over your mind is so you can maintain balance in your life, which is how you successfully approach your recovery without incessantly struggling.

In my opinion, it's also the only way to successfully get through recovery. There's no possible way I could have gotten more than 300+ days PMO free if I'd been struggling with urges every day, let alone every week.


{{< hr3 "In fact, a wonderful consequence of having balance is that you'll no longer experience urges at all." >}}


Often the reason why people struggle with urges in very specific circumstances (for example, when it's late at night or when we're intoxicated) is because these situations inherently disturb our normal everyday balance.

So what does orgasm have to do with any of this?

Well, the reason why I highly recommend that you don't orgasm during your recovery is because it significantly affects our ability to remain balanced.

The dopamine rush we experience from orgasm, with or without porn, is significant.

This is in part why orgasm for a lot of people is huge trigger for people to watch porn, myself included.

Not only because of the association that orgasm has with the feeling of watching porn, but also in large part because of the dopamine response we experience which leaves us feeling uneasy.

The name of the game when it comes to porn addiction recovery is stability, and the more stable you can become, the better chance you'll have at successfully moving on.

Proponents will argue that orgasm is healthy if it's without porn, however I would disagree (and also agree) for a number of reasons.

As previously mentioned, it messes with our emotions which is a big no-no, and which I don't consider healthy within the context of recovery.

Certainly while I don't believe there's necessarily anything wrong with orgasming once you are recovered from your addiction, while you're recovering it's a completely different story.

Although I suppose it comes down to the standard you set for yourself. I personally continue not to orgasm inspite of being recovered, because I enjoy the energy boost that comes from semen retention.

What about sex? Well, personally I continue to have sex without orgasming and it hasn't changed the quality of sex I've had.

I suppose this discussion highlights my attitude towards recovery, in particular that there's no such thing as healthy moderation.

I don't believe humans are capable of moderating their own addiction, otherwise they wouldn't have become addicted within the first place.

Instead, I believe abstinence is the only true answer and that abstinence within itself doesn't have to be difficult or frustrating.

With techniques such as meditation, abstinence can become incredibly easy and certainly a whole lot more effective than trying to moderate dopamine producing behaviours.

And certainly, a lot of this rhetoric comes from people who are still addicted to porn and assume that the world operates on some sort of dopamine response, even if it's not from porn/masturbation/orgasm.

What they don't realise is that this is merely as a result of their addiction. In truth, once you overcome your addiction and you learn to remain calm and aware, you won't have any desire for dopamine-producing activities at all.

You'll simply become happy and content with yourself.

But of course, you haven't experienced pro-longed balance for a very long period of time, then it's impossible to know that.

Which is probably why people struggle with porn addiction for so long, because they assume that it's all about dopamine in the end and that there's no alternative to pursuing dopamine in some form.

So in summary, it's in your best interest not to orgasm during your recovery, as it makes recovery significantly more difficult.

I don't care about moral arguments or whether you think it's "natural". I'm all about stating effective processes and this is one of them.
