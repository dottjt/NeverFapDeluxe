<!-- To Finish -->

Men (and potentially women, although I don't think I can fairly speak on their behalf) generally struggle not to stare at women in public.

Especially men who are addicted to porn.

It's like the moment you catch glimpse of someone you find attractive, it's game over and you feel as if you can't help but stare.

In a lot of cases, it's even actively encouraged by our male peers as a talking point, and yeah. That's just the natural state of things as of 2020.

Well, I think it's something that's worth addressing and something which can be ultimately prevented.

For starters, it can help to understand that there's nothing inherently "normal" or "natural" about staring at women.

Sure, it may feel natural, no different to how watching porn on a daily basis or smoking a pack of cigarettes a day may feel natural for some.

However what's key to understand is that staring at others is nothing more than a trained behaviour which you've engaged with since you were a child, and it's only once we've developed the ability not to

Another thing to understand is that this isn't so much a process of learning to refrain from these behaviours, as it is a process of learning to become more comfortable with yourself.

Part of the reason why you stare at others is because you're not mentally engage with yourself. Instead, you mind goes into "seeking" mode and it's as if you're not really there with yourself.

Of course, refraining is also important, but it can help to think of it more as a side-effect of being comfortable with yourself and who you are as a person.

If you can keep these things in mind while you practice this, you'll go a long way towards developing that control over your mind.


{{< hr3 "So how the hell do I actually do this? ">}}


Personally speaking, there's two things which really help not engage with this behaviour.

The first is realising and understand the dynamics of why we stare at women, which will help you learn to become more comfortable with yourself.

The second is the actual physical technique of not staring, which dramatically simplifies the whole process.

So you simply cannot stare, out of principle, meaning that your head won't fundamentally allow you to.

Cause like, muscle n' bones n' stuff.

A large part of the reason why we stare at others is because we're simply not engaged with ourselves.


{{< hr3 "In a lot of cases, it's because we feel powerless not to do it." >}}


What can help is to understand that when you stare at another person, you're essentially giving your power away to them.

It's not something innocent. It's not something inherently natural. It's a process of giving up our power to another person.

That's why you feel powerless, because you're literally giving your power away.

In other words, to not stare is actually to give the power back to us,




In terms of actually not staring, there are a few things which I do which I find helps me significantly.

For starters, I find it helps to actually look above people's heads into the distance in general, as that helps you avoid staring at people.


In addition, it can help to turn the activity into a game, or a mental challenge if you will.

Get excited at the fact that by not staring at others you're actually improving as a person. Embrace the feeling that you're retaining your power as an individual.
