A lot of people express cynicism at the idea of meditation.

They think it's some kind of spiritual mumbo-jumbo


It's a bit like saying that most Christians eat food, therefore eating food is a largely Christian activity.

And really, I compared meditation to things like eating and sleeping because I treat mental health as fundamental maintenance.
