People severely over-complicate porn addiction recovery.

And a consequence of this is that people focus on all the wrong things at all the wrong times, and then wonder why they've been struggling so much.

Which causes all sorts of doubts over our ability to recover, and which leaves us trapped within our own confusion.

Well, I suppose what I want to do with this article is provide you with some perspective, so you can change how you think about recovery.

From something confusing, to something empowering. 

Because really, even if you don't fully understand nor feel fully comfortable with the dynamics of recovery, that doesn't mean you need to feel left in the dark.


{{< hr3 "And once you understand the basic economics of recovery, it will make you realise that it's literally nothing more than a numbers game. " >}}


Here's the deal bucko.

It can help to understand that recovery is purely relative. 

Which is to say that all you have to do is do more than the average in order to suceed.

The average person isn't meditation etc. 




- It's a numbers game (How it can help to think of recovery as a number's and statistics game. You committing to certain things put you ahead of others. You being ahead statistically means you will succeed.) It's about doing more than others.
