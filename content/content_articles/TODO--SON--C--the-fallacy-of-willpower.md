Willpower is a lie.

It's a fabulous lie peddled by all sorts of celebrities and self-help gurus as an unlimited source of potential and opportunity, which can allow you attain absolutely anything you desire.

It's a lie because it leads people to develop this entirely inflated idea of what willpower actually is, when in reality willpower itself isn't even a coping strategy. 

In fact, it's all just completely made up, however let's explore this idea for a moment.


{{< hr3 "What is willpower exactly?" >}}


Well, willpower is this idea that sheer determination can help us get through anything regardless of perspective, insight or strategy.

It is the equivalent to banging your head against a door for 12 hours, hoping it will open a window.

Willpower is literal madness and quite frankly, the lowest form of inspiration available to humans.

So why has willpower become so prevalent as an idea for change?

Well there are two primary reasons I can think of.

Part of it has to do with the fact that most humans simply don't know better, which is why it's become such an amazing idea for people to peddle, package and abuse as a solution to all of life's problems. 

"Things aren't working out? Well, it's because you need more willpower you silly billy!"

The other reason is because it's an incredibly easy idea for people to grasp on a fundamental level, and this in large part comes down to the way most people have been taught to think.

That is, in terms of judgement and self-criticism, which is essentially how this desire for willpower is often expressed. 

In fact, the only time anyone ever speaks of willpower is when the going gets tough or when things aren't going the way people intend.

Which says a hell of a lot about the nature of willpower, or at least how it's used, if it's used primarily to 


{{< hr3 "So what's the alternative to willpower?" >}}


Well, if I had to describe what willpower is, I would describe it as something people do when they don't have a solid strategy in place.

Willpower is what you do when you don't know what to do and if willpower truly worked out of principle, no one would have any problems.









In particular, it encompasses this idea that willpower trumps all, which is not only incorrect, but sets a false precendence for people, which leads to frustration and relapse.

The alternative to willpower is technique.






In fact, I believe that willpower is the . 



I will be quite clear about this now, willpower is not a valid coping strategy in any way, shape or form.

If you rely on willpower to help you get through your urges, then you are doing it wrong and you will relapse.

Willpower is not an effective coping mechanism.

In fact, I would go as far as to say that one of the primary reasons why people find themselves stuck in a cycle of relapse, because they assume willpower is enough to help them overcome porn addiction.

It absolutely is not, and never will be.





<!-- {{< hr3 "It would be like me telling you that drawing pictures of trees will make you obscenely happy." >}}


And that the more trees you draw, the happier you'll get.

So you draw a few hundred trees, but it gets tiring. Not to mention, you don't feel any happier.

So you tell yourself "Well, if I just had the willpower to continue drawing pictures of trees, then I wouldn't be in this rut". -->
