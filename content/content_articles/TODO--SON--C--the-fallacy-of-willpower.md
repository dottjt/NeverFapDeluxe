People wildly abuse this idea of willpower.

In fact, even considering willpower as a valid coping strategy is abuse within itself.

I will be quite clear about this now, willpower is not a valid coping strategy in any way, shape or form.

If you rely on willpower to help you get through your urges, then you are doing it wrong and you will relapse.

Willpower is not an effective coping mechanism.

In fact, I would go as far as to say that one of the primary reasons why people find themselves stuck in a cycle of relapse, because they assume willpower is enough to help them overcome porn addiction.

It absolutely is not, and never will be.

If I had to describe what willpower is, I would describe it as something people do when they don't have a solid strategy in place.

Willpower is what you do when you don't know what to do and if willpower truly worked out of principle, no one would have any problems.

So what is willpower exactly?

Well, willpower is this idea that sheer will can help us get through anything, regardless of perspective, insight or strategy to help us get through hard times.

Willpower is equivalent to banging your head against the wall for 12 hours,

It is a false god


In particular, this idea that willpower trumps all. Not only is it incorrect, but it sets a false precendence for people, which leads to frustration and relapse.

The alternative to willpower is technique.
