I think people abuse and misuse this idea of willpower.

In large part because they completely misunderstand this idea of willpower, well beyond what it actually is. 

In fact, I would go as far as to say that one of the primary reasons why people find themselves stuck in a cycle of relapse is because of the amount of emphasis that place on willpower as a solution to their problems.

The fallacy of willpower. 
- I hate it when people preach willpower as a solution to everything.

In particular, this idea that willpower trumps all. Not only is it incorrect, but it sets a false precendence for people, which leads to frustration and relapse. 

The alternative to willpower is technique.
