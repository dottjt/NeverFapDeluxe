<!-- 99% DONE - ONE EDIT -->

Willpower is a lie.

It's a fabulous lie peddled by all sorts of celebrities and self-help gurus as an unlimited source of potential and opportunity, which can allow you attain absolutely anything you want in life.

It's a lie because it leads people to develop all sorts of inflated ideas as to how humans learn and progress, well beyond which humans are capable of.

In fact, willpower itself isn't even a coping strategy, so let's dive a little deeper into why this is.


{{< hr3 "What is willpower exactly?" >}}


Well, willpower is this idea that sheer determination can help us get through anything regardless of perspective, insight or strategy.

It is the equivalent of banging your head against a door for 12 hours, inspite of the fact that the previous 12 hours have proved that what you were doing clearly hasn't been working.

It is easily the lowest form of inspiration available to humans, so why has willpower become so prevalent as an idea for change?

There are a few reasons I can think of.

Part of the reason is because it's a self-fulfilling struggling which people remain completely blind to. In fact, and you'll notice that no one ever speaks of willpower until they start struggling with the task at hand.

In other words, willpower is nothing more a false sense of hope.

So you're struggling to push through? Well, the reason why is because you need more 'willpower', silly! Which essentially means continuing to do the exact same thing as you were previously, inspite of the fact that what you have been doing clearly hasn't been working out, otherwise you wouldn't be struggling as you are in the first place.

But of course, that's also why it's become such an amazing idea for people to peddle, package and abuse as a solution to all of life's problems. 


{{< hr3 "Because no matter what, you can always blame and attribute your struggle to a lack of willpower, and it's absolutely something which cannot be disproved." >}}


For whatever reason, people will attach to this kind of one-sided logic like crack-cocaine, because most people don't particularly care whether they are being effective or not. 

Instead, they're merely seek justification in order to feel a sense of hope and purpose for their actions, in order to address the guilt and shame their feel in their daily lives. 

I also think a big reason why people resort to this idea of willpower, is because it doesn't require any thought.

It's really easy to just say "It's because I didn't have enough willpower", than actually engage in meaningful change, and this an especially huge issue for those even trying to take NeverFap Deluxe seriously.

They'll practice the exercises, but the moment they face a difficult situation, it's like they immediately return back to old habits and they don't use the skills they've been developing this whole time.

Well, I'm here to tell you that there is literally no alternative to conscious engaging with your mind.

It is the only path towards meaningful change, and the sooner you understand this, the sooner you can break out of these cycles of guilt and relapse which plague so many people.


{{< hr3 "Ultimately if I had to describe what willpower is, I would describe it as something people pursue when they don't have a solid strategy in place." >}}


It's what people resort to when they don't have a set of effective fundamental principles in place, and so continue to blindly do the same thing over and over again. 

It's false hope, at it's purest. 

So what's the alternative to willpower?

Well, almost everything is an alternative to willpower. Whether that be further educating yourself, devising a solid strategy or returning back to a set of fundamental principles, all these things will help you with your path moving forward.

This idea of willpower relates back to one of The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap Deluxe, Struggle Over None, which states that anything which makes our recovery more difficult cannot fundamentally help us. 

Believe it or not, willpower as an idea actually makes our recovery more difficult, because in no way does it provide us with the skills or tools in order to work and proceed more efficiently. 

It does the exact opposite of this and it goes without saying that willpower is not a valid coping strategy in any way, shape or form.

If you rely on willpower to help you get through your urges, then you are merely leaving your recovery to chance and you will always end up relapsing.

I would even go as far as to say that this idea of willpower one of the primary reasons why people find themselves stuck in a cycle of relapse, because they assume willpower is enough to help them overcome porn addiction.

It absolutely is not, and never will be.

Only through conscious change can we learn to develop control over our minds, and live our lives to our fullest potential.
