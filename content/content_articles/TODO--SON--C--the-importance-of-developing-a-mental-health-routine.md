<!-- Nearly finished. -->

I always find it interesting when I talk to people and they tell me that they don't have a mental health routine in place.

It's a bit like trying to navigate through a jungle without a map. You're going to get lost, relapse and probably die from dengue fever.

So many people try to 'wing it' because they think they know better, and literally always ends the same way every single time.

Like, without fault.

So what exactly is a mental health routine or plan?


{{< hr3 "Put simply, it's a strategy you have in place in order to help you develop healthy coping mechanisms." >}}


Furthermore, it's going to help you verify what you do and don't know about yourself.

For example, do you have a strategy to help you deal with early morning urges? If not, then you're literally leaving your recovery to chance.

Like, no shit. By not having a strategy you're literally accepting that you'll have no idea how to respond when faced with a compromising situation.

The other reason why having a strategy is important is because it can help us address future situations where we inherently get lost, like when we're feeling completely demotivated and depressed. 

And the way we do this is by having solid principles in place, which help guide us when we feel lost and clueless. 

For example, understanding that we must always aim to remain calm and not react to our emotions and feelings, even though they may be unbearable at times.

When you don't have a plan, we usually fail to remain aware of these things, and we end up doing something stupid that we regret. 

Especially given that our awareness is already limited by the fact that we are addicts to begin with.


{{< hr3 "So what does a mental health plan usually contain?" >}}


Well, at a bare minimum it should contain a consistent routine of meditation, as that is arguably the most important thing you can do for your mind from a mental health perspective.

Ultimately, a solid mental health plan should equally be about preventative maintenance, as it is should be about how to best to address difficult situations.

And that's really what meditation is about, helping you remain in balance so you don't even get to a point of experiencing urges, because you're already in-control of yourself.

Your plan should also contain a list of actions and strategies to help you deal with a bunch of common scenarios you struggle with.

For example, you may really struggle with boredom or stress when it comes to dealing with your urges, and so even identifying those situations an go a long way towards mentally preparing for them well-ahead of time.

A key thing to understand about your porn recovery journey is that there really is no silver-bullet when it comes to overcoming porn addiction.

I mean, sure.

Meditation is that silver-bullet for a lot of people, in a sense that it's such an all-encompassing skill which provides people with a huge amount of leverage in terms of allowing them to developing control over their minds.

Or even recognising that we may not be truly present with ourselves, so we can prevent ourselves from truly derailing within a few hours' time. 

Because that's really what effective porn addiction recovery is about. It's about being able to make those difficult, conscious decisions when we are most vulnerable.

So essentially it encompasses a few different things:


- Your preventative plan i.e. Your daily meditation/self-care routine
- Your reactive plan i.e. How you should respond to difficult situations
- A list of fundamental principles for you to follow no matter what.


And really, if you can do those things, you've honestly done more than most people who attempt to overcome their porn addiction. 

In summary, your strategy is your roadmap for change. Without it, you severely limit your outcomes, as well as your ability to respond effectively.

It can help to understand that porn addiction recovery isn't a simple process of flicking a switch labeled 'turn off porn addiction' on the back of your mind.

Instead, it is a hard process of practice and consistency, which
