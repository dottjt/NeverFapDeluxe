People seem to be interested in what The Reade&copy; is up to, so I thought I might share my meditation routine with people.

Essentially, I'm the kind of person who likes to keep things as simple as possible.


{{< hr3 "I meditate 10 minutes before bed each night, and that's really all there is to it." >}}


Furthermore, that's all we really need.

People seem to overcomplicate this whole idea of meditation as this "hardcore" practice which must be treated religiously.

As if we should be meditating 40 minutes each day under perfect circumstances, otherwise we risk derailing and losing all our hard work.

When really, meditation is supposed to be calm and simple.

I suppose it's a bit like when you're getting ready for a big night out on the town, and you're worrying about your hairstyle or what you're wearing.

That's the opposite of what meditation should be. There should be no stress or thought.

It should be as casual as popping on sandals to walk down to the local shops in order to pick up milk.

That's how effective meditation begins.

One piece of key advice I'd provide newcomers with.


{{< hr3 "Is to treat meditation no different to eating or brushing your teeth." >}}


It's nothing special. It's nothing extraordinary. There's no reason to freak out or worry.

All we are doing is continuing our basic human maintenance for the day, so we can live the rest of our day struggle-free.

That's really the real reason why we're committing that 10 minutes each day, so we can maintain ourselves.

That is what balance is after all.

It's not us reacting to our emotions and putting our fires when we see them. It's following best practice so we don't have to put out fires at all.

In addition to this 10 minutes, sometimes I also like to do practice meditation when I'm out in public, although I certainly wouldn't say it's strictly necessary.


{{< hr3 "For example I usually practice mindfulness/meditation when I'm walking somewhere or waiting for something." >}}


For example, I will usually meditate as I'm walking to the train station to get to work in the morning, or while waiting at the train station for the next train to arrive.

These situations are excellent opportunities to meditate, often because there are quite a lot of things to observe - which actually makes the meditation a lot easier to conduct.

Of course, what's important is finding a routine that works for you.

Personally speaking, I like to do my 10 minutes of meditation at night before bed, because that's also when I write my accountability post and is what helps me relax and sleep better.

In addition, another piece of advice I would provide is that if you are going to spend a significant amount of time meditating, I would space them out rather than do them in huge chunks.

In the context of overcoming porn addiction, meditation isn't like physical exercise where the longer you do it, and the more intense your session, the more you'll gain from it.

Instead, much like this idea of regular maintanance, it can help to spread these sessions out.

Like, there's no point brushing your teeth for two hours once a month. That's not how dental hygiene works. You need to be doing it everyday.

Ultimately if you think of meditation as a practice which is designed to help you maintain balance over your mind, you can think of each session as helping you be mindful of this balance in order to help you actively pursue it.

A bit like drinking water throughout the day in order to keep you hydrated.

Essentially what meditation does is that it grounds you back to your present self, and so doing this frequently throughout the day is more useful than trying to push through longer sessions.

But of course, you'll come to develop your own routine that works for you, as we all have different areas which we struggle with.

For example, you may want to focus on some of the awareness and calmness practices we have on the website, which can be super useful if you're just starting out.
