Today I want to write about the fundamental difference between NoFap and NeverFap Deluxe.

Part of the reason why I created NeverFap Deluxe was to address the shortcomings of NoFap, and it's important for you to understand these shortcomings so you can make better decisions about your porn addiction recovery.

Put simply, the primary problem with NoFap is that there is no "NoFap Method" for people to follow. 

When you ask people what NoFap is, their typical response is that it's ideology which promotes giving up porn, but that's about as far as the dialog goes. 

In no way does it concretely explain how to actually achieve this, which is why almost everyone has a different opinion in regards to what porn addiction recovery should entail.

In other words, NoFap isn't opinionated and this is a large part of the reason why so many people continue to struggle with overcoming porn addiction, simply because there isn't a unified understanding of how to actually approach it.

So that people could actually have a method that not only makes sense, but is as clear as daylight in terms of what is required and how it can be acheived.

Ultimately, NeverFap Deluxe is about the use of meditation in order to help us maintain balance in life, and we're very clear about this. 

Of course, as a result of directionless of the NoFap movement, a slew of bad practice has resulted from the NoFap community, which unfortunately has become standard in terms of how most people understand porn addiction recovery today.

Perhaps the worst thing which has resulted has been this idea of maintaining these PMO streaks as a viable means of coping and maintaining motivation.

The basic idea is that you count the number of days since your last relapse as a metric to ensure that you're following the program, and it's such a huge distraction, I honestly would have no idea where to begin with describing how truly pointless it is.

And while this seems innocent enough
