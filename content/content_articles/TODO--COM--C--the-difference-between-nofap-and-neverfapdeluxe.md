Today I want to write about the fundamental difference between NoFap and NeverFap Deluxe.

Part of the reason why I created NeverFap Deluxe was to address the shortcomings of NoFap and that's really what I want to discuss today.

Put simply, the primary problem with NoFap is that there is no "NoFap Method" for people to follow. 

When you ask people what NoFap is, often the response you get is "It's that thing where you stop masturbating to porn." but that's about as far as the dialog goes. 

And this is in large part why so many people are still struggling to overcome it, because no one actually knows how to do it.

So that people could actually have a method that was as clear as daylight.
