<!-- One More Edit -->

I think this is an important topic to discuss, because the porn addiction recovery process can be a particularly emotional one, which can lead to all sorts of thoughts and opinions which may not necessarily be productive to our recovery. 

Especially in the midst of relapse where we can feel angry, frustrated and broken, as if porn itself has become this kind of conceptual devil which refuses us to let us continue to live with any sort of integrity.

Well, rather than create these false narratives which in no way helps us develop Healthy Coping Mechanisms, nor helps us develop control over our minds in any meaningful way.

Let's instead try and understand these feelings a little better, so we can move past them and grow as individuals.

So is there anything fundamentally wrong with porn?


{{< hr3 "Personally speaking, I don't believe there is anything fundamentally wrong with porn." >}}


In fact, this whole idea of anything being fundamentally wrong is simply counter-productive to our own personal development as individuals.

Ultimately, the main reason for this is because any amount of belief requires an extrodinary amount of emotion and conviction to maintain.

Energy which we simply do not have, especially when you consider the amount of energy that already gets taken from us on a daily basis from our pre-existing feelings of judgement, self-criticism, guilt and shame.

Not to mention from other unresolved mental health issues as well, which can leave us so emotionally drained that we simply don't care whether we relapse or not.

That's why at NeverFap Deluxe, we place such a strong emphasis on process instead, because process has a minimal overhead and doesn't require trapping yourself within complex moral arguments.

You simply stick to the core principles, learn to remain as aware and calm as possible, and literally everything will fall into place. 

Ultimately, what a lot of people fail to realise is that recovery is actually a process of learning to let go, which means letting of everything in the purest sense.

Your thoughts, your feelings, your judgements, your prejudices, your ego. 

Things which you don't truly own, yet have become convinced are inseperable from your human being, no different to how you view your own porn addiction as an inseperable part of who you are. 

The sooner you learn to let go, the sooner you'll recover and once you do recover, you'll realise how silly it was that you held on for so long.

Especially, looking back at all these judgements, beliefs and grudges which you'll be like, "Wow, I can't believe I spent so much time doing that, when I just have just been focusing on self-improvement and self-empowerment instead".


{{< hr3 "I suppose to point I'm trying to get at is that neutrality always reigns supreme." >}}


It's simply impossible to remain neutral while also believing something is fundamentally wrong, and anything which makes our recovery more difficult makes no zero sense in my books.

You know, the purpose of overcoming porn addiction isn't to feel justified or superior in our actions. It's to put an end to harmful behaviours, which extends not only to our porn viewing habits, but also our feelings about porn viewing itself.

So no, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with porn, just as there is nothing fundamentally right about recovering from porn addiction.

Instead, it's about acknowledging that these are merely behaviours at the end of the day which we are trying to change, which do not have any significance outside of the consequence and actions which we are trying to influence.

And once you embrace this kind of honesty, it can help empower you without the feelings of guilt or shame or whatever pre-conceived notions people may have about recovery.

Dissolve the narrative. Reclaim your responbility.

This is what effective recovery is about.
