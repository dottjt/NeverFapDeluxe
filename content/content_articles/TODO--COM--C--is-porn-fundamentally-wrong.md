I think it's important to discuss these topics, because the porn addiction recovery process can be a particularly emotional journey, if not an outright conflicting one at times.

Especially in the midst of relapse where we can feel angry and frustrated and feel as if porn itself has become this kind of conceptual devil which refuses us to let us continue on with our lives in any capacity.

Well, let's try and understand this a bit better and turn potentially bitter narratives, into something more constructive.

Ultimately, the main reason for this is because I don't believe anything good can come from maintaining this belief. 

On a fundamental level, believing that anything in life is "fundamentally wrong" requires an extrodinary amount of emotion and conviction which we simply do not have.

Which is to say that you're going to have an incredibly difficult time overcoming your porn addiction if you maintain this belief, and since overcoming your porn addiction really is priority, you better listen up. 

Part of what makes NeverFap Deluxe effective is that it promotes neutrality.

Not only does it lend towards this seemingly self-created complex of guilt, which makes us feel shameful for our actions when we do struggle.

However it's a form of rationalisation which directly within itself is an Unhealthy Coping Mechanism, as rationalisation detracts from our ability to develop control over our minds.
