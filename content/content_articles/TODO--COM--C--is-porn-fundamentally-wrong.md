Is Porn Fundamentally Wrong?

I think it's important to discuss these topics, because the porn addiction recovery process can be a particularly emotional journey, if not outright conflicting at times.

Especially in the midst of relapse where we can get angry and frustrated and feel as if porn itself has become this kind of conceptual devil which refuses us to let us continue with our lives.

Well, let's try and change that narrative into something more constructive.

Personally speaking, I don't believe there is anything fundamentally wrong with porn.

Part of the reason for this is because you'll have an incredibly difficult time overcoming your porn addiction until you reach this point of acceptance, so listen up folks.

Ultimately what NeverFap Deluxe is about is promoting neutrality, and it's really hard to do that when you believe that the very thing you are trying to address is "evil".

Not only does it lend towards this seemingly self-created complex of guilt, which makes us feel shameful for our actions when we do struggle.

However it's a form of rationalisation which directly within itself is an Unhealthy Coping Mechanism, as rationalisation detracts from our ability to develop control over our minds.
