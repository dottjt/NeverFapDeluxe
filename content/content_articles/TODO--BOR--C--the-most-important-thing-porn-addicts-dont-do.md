It's sort of interesting to observe those who do really well with NeverFap Deluxe, and those who simply don't.

As someone who talks to literally hundreds of porn addicts each week, I've become quite adept at identifying other people's problems.

In large part, because almost all porn addicts share the exact same problems, and once you identify the core problems, you literally become an automated jukebox of sorts.  

And as a guide of sorts, it's my job to try and desperately guide people on what they should be doing, and it can be a frustrating job at times, because although I can literally see what is going on in their mind in vivid detail.

They're often completely oblivious to almost all their own short-comings, in a way that often makes it impossible for me to describe those details in any meaningful way.

It's like, although we're both speaking the same language, that doesn't necessarily translate in a way that another person can adopt in a constructive way.

Part of the problem is that this idea of 'awareness' is such an individual concept that it's almost impossible to truly explain what it is without getting lost in the subjectivity that is our own living experience.

Especially when you're trying to explain these concepts to porn addicts who are inherently delusional, and who are adamantly detached from reality, and who don't believe that there's anything wrong with their own capacity for conscious awareness.

It's part of the reason why addicts will meditate briefly, only to fail to see the value in it because it hasn't clicked in any meaningful way, which leads them to never attempt meditation again.

Without realising that the reason why it didn't click is because they never fully understood how to meditate correctly, nor with the right mindset.

All because they've most likely misunderstood this concept of conscious awareness, and how a practice like meditation interacts with that. 

Which hey, is exactly what I went through with my own journey, so I'm certainly not blaming anyone.

However, it's also part of the reason why I delayed my own porn addiction recovery by a good 5 years, simply because I was too cynical to understand otherwise.

And perhaps if I'd been taught differently, I would have recovered much, much sooner. 

So with all this in mind, what is the biggest mistake that porn addicts make in regards to their porn addiction recovery?


{{< hr3 "The biggest mistake people make is that they don't conscious engage with their minds." >}}


A key thing to understand about practices such as meditation, is that their sole purpose is to assist you in consciously engage with your mind. 

Sitting there and "committing" to 10 minutes of meditation without truly engaging with your mind, is no better than not meditating at all. 

And certainly, that's what I was doing without realising it. 

My idea of meditation back in the day was simply that you sort of sat there without thinking. 

You know, like to just "empty your mind" and sit there in a state of calm.

Which is a strong part of it, but also completely misses the purpose of it.

Meditation isn't about empty your mind. It's about consciously engaging with your mind in order to empty it. It truly is how you do it which counts.

The reason why it's important to conscious engage your mind is because that's what is going to result in meaningful change. 

So for example, when you experience an urge to watch porn and you're feeling as if you're losing control, you can consciously stop your mind and dissolve that urge in a healthy way.

Because you sitting there and "emptying your thoughts" without consciously engaging your mind as you may have been doing, simply isn't going to cut it when you have an urge. 


{{< hr3 "The idea being that by practicing this activity while our mind is relatively stable, it will help us to actually deal with these difficult situations with ease." >}}


So to the tough question, how do you consciously engage with your mind? Well, there are a number of exercises in our practices section which deal with this. 

It really is as simple as using your mind in a calculated way without thought. 

Direct your attention. Direct your mind. A good exercise you can do is to simply stare at your hand and look at it and really take notice of the object you're looking at.

Any kind of exercise which directly connects you to reality and to yourself is great for this, especially with your own feelings and emotions.

Ultimately, understand that there is no alternative to using your brain, as you have been designed to do as a human being.

Perhaps you have spent most of your life trying to escape who you are and to keep your mind preoccupied with endless distractions. 

Well, we're here to address that so your mind is king. 

Without a conscious mind you are nothing.
