This is an interesting topic to discuss, in part because I get a lot of questions about whether masturbation is okay within the context of porn recovery.

I'm also excited to write this article because I have a very clear answer to this question which I think will make a lot of sense to both addicts and non-addicts alike.

So, is masturbation healthy?

In order to answer this question, we really need to dive a bit deeper into why we're asking this question to begin with, and in particular, why people masturbate within the first place.

Ultimately, it comes down to coping mechanisms.

When you think about the reason why people masturbate and watch porn, it's because that's their response to coping with the emotions and feelings they're currently experiencing.

It could be because those feelings and emotions make them feel uncomfortable, and so they're looking for a way to distract themselves.

It could be because that's simply how they've learnt to respond, irrespective of what these emotions and feelings are, both pleasant and unpleasant.

Of course, these responses can reach a point of addiction and dependance if we continue to pursue them, as is often the case.

And part of the porn addiction recovery process is learning to develop healthier coping mechanisms, not only so we can replace this dependence, however also learn to cope more effectively.

So really, asking if masturbation is healthy isn't an adequate enough question to truly understand what we are trying to understand.

Instead, it might make more sense to ask.

If you feel that you are dependant upon masturbation in order to cope, then chances are that you have a problem.

If you feel like masturbation doesn't affect your ability cope, and is something you can externalise and not take personally, then it has the opportunity to be a healthy thing for you.

Of course, that still doesn't necessarily answer the question of whether masturbation is healthy or not, so I'll try and do that now based on what I've experienced and what I've seen others experience.

Certainly, if you have an existing porn addiction then masturbation is not healthy.

You may choose to masturbate again once you have overcome your porn addiction, however in most cases that usually ends back to watching porn.

So in my opinion, porn addicts should refrain from masturbation permanently.

With that said, it's also not a question porn addicts need to even think or worry about about.

Because part of overcoming porn addiction is developing healthier coping mechanisms, so that once you are recovered, not only will you not be thinking about masturbation at all, however you'll have much more effective and empowering strategies to deal with your emotions as well.

So really, asking whether masturbation is healthy or not is a distraction from developing healthy coping mechanisms, which is a vital part of the porn addiction recovery process.

While there is a possibility that masturbation may be healthy under certain circumstances and for different people, in no way is it a question that will help you with your recovery.

Instead, remember to always focus on the process.

The process will set you free.
