NeverFap Deluxe is a comprehensive method of overcoming porn addiction.

It is the easiest and most effective method I know, based on my own experiences with overcoming porn addiction over the past five years.


{{< hr3 "I would describe NeverFap as a system which is designed to provide you with control." >}}


Control over your mind. Control over your actions. Control over your thoughts. Control over your feelings and emotions.

Now, chances are that none of this is new to you. 

Chances are that you have been attempting self-control in some form or another for a while now, however it just hasn't quite worked out.

Maybe your porn cravings still get the best of you. Maybe you feel as if you don't even have control over your mood and emotions.

Maybe you've completely normalised all these feelings and you don't believe that self-control is even possible.


{{< hr2 "Well, chances are that you've been doing it wrong this whole time." >}}


Certainly, I was doing it completely wrong for the first five years of my porn recovery and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

We all learn differently. We all have different life experiences. 

That's just how humans are.

The thing to understand about self-control is that it's completely counter-intuitive.

It's counter-intuitive in the sense that since you don't have self-control, everything that you currently know has no relation to helping you understand self-control.

Porn addicts don't know about self-control.

Porn addicts know about being addicted to porn, because that's what they are.

It's what they live on a daily basis. It's how they understand and relate to the world around them.


{{< hr3 "So there's a few steps we must take in order to address this." >}}


For starters, we need to learn self-control from someone who knows how.

Which is easier said than done, because this then requires a change in attitude which you may not be used to.

For example, in order to learn something from someone this entails both trust and commitment.

Two things which porn addicts generally don't have. 

Porn addicts are generally skeptics and can barely commit to anything, since they don't already have control over their emotions.

In part because they over-rely on their emotions, which change in an instant from "I can do this!" to "Man, I really need to watch porn".


{{< hr3 "So what hope is there?" >}}


Well, it can help to understand that no one is expecting you to beat this thing within a day.

Overcoming porn addiction is the kind of thing which may take you years to understand.

What the NeverFap method does is start you with small commitments, so that you can more easily work up to larger ones. 

A key thing to understand is that learning self-control, and really anything for that matter, isn't driven by goals and expectations. 

Learning is driven by the small things you do each day to practice it.


{{< hr2 "Instead, the problem is that you're spending so much time fighting these goals and expectations." >}}


That you don't feel motivated, nor even comfortable committing to these practices, due to fear, doubt and a whole trope of negative emotions.

And you're fighting these goals and expectations, why?

Well, as I said earlier. 

Self-control is counter-intuitive for those addicted to porn. 

Often the reason why we've set these goals and expectations in the first place, is because that is what we understand will help us move forward.

Chances are that this is what we learnt as kids, or perhaps it is all we have ever known.

Again, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. 

We're not here to judge, nor condemn. We're here to learn and become better people.

In order to address this, the NeverFap method takes a strong focus on practicing meditation.

Put simply.


{{< hr3 "Meditation is the easiest and most effective way that I know how to develop self-control." >}}


The primary skill we will be learning in regards to meditation is observation. 

If I had to describe the most important skill you can learn to help you overcome your porn addiction, I would say that observation is that skill.

Observation truly encompasses the default state of mind that you should be in almost all of the time.

<!--TODO: I talk more about it in this article Article on observation -->
And furthermore, developing observation is easy.
