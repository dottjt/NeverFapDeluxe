<!-- Short article. Just needs another edit. -->

Some people have this idea that you develop these "super powers" once you manage to successfully overcome your porn addiction.

Where you die and transcend humanity itself, becoming a god in the midst of mortals.

I think the reason why people believe this is because of how extraordinarily difficult most people find porn addiction recovery.

Like, if it's this difficult, then perhaps some kind of huge reward awaits us on the otherside once we "crack the code".

But this simply isn't true, at least how I imagine most people are understanding it, so this is something I want to address today.


{{< hr3 "Ultimately, what overcoming porn addiction allows you greater purpose in life." >}}


What does this mean?

Well, it means that you'll now have more time and energy to explore other aspects of life, which previously you'd spent supporting your addiction.

These new "super powers" are that you now have unlimited freedom to do what you want in life, and if that's not an idea which absolutely excites you, then you're likely thinking about it the wrong way.

I think where most people are mislead is that they somehow think that outcomes and attributes, like being smart, social and funny are like angels that suddenly into your life.

Or as if their porn addiction is a kind veil which has been covering these positive attributes all along. 

This isn't how life works in the slightest. 


{{< hr3 "Instead, life is more like a bucket of sand you fill with more sand." >}}


The more time and energy you spend filling that bucket of sand, the more sand you'll have. Of course, in the case of life, instead of sand it's knowledge, skill and ability.

And literally, all overcoming porn addiction allows you to do is spend more time and energy filling that bucket, with more focus and determination before.

In no way does the bucket fundamentally change. In no way does sand magically appear in the bucket.

You are now simply more mentally equiped to fill this bucket with sand and to derive purposes from this pursuit. 

In order words, overcoming porn addiction isn't necessarily going to help you appreciate the value of hard work, nor help you understand this purpose.

And hell, maybe you don't actually even care about this whole idea of having "super powers" and you're perfectly fine simply being more mentally and emotionally stable than you were before.

That's also cool too. 

Another important thing to realise is that although learning to appreciate your new-found freedom is a separate skill that must be learnt, this isn't to say that overcoming porn addiction itself isn't a useful skill 


{{< hr3 "It will teach you discipline, determination and self-control - all aspects which can help you with your life post addiction." >}}


Certainly, it's hard to deny the increased energy and emotional stability which comes with no longer being addicted, but ultimately it comes down to your motivations at the end of the day, and I suppose for me I've been pursuing this journey so I can become a more productive individual.

I think a large part of it comes down to better understand what progress is about.
