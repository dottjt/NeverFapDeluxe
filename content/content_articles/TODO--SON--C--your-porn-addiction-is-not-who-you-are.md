Most of us probably have a very complex relationship with our addiction.

So much so that we can forget which aspects of our personality may be as a result of our addiction.

Which in most cases, leads to questioning the very fabric of who we think we are.

Am I actually attracted to these extreme fetishes? Are they merely a result of my addiction? Do I actually have severe depression, or are these feelings merely a by-product of my recovery? 

Perhaps you may even question, are the positive and fun aspects of my personality also due to my addiction, and will I lose them if I lose my addiction?

There are so many moving parts to consider when it comes to trying to understand all our thoughts and feelings that it's understandable why some people crumble helplessly in trying to process it all.

In this article I want to address some of these concerns on a high level so you can have a better understanding of what is actually going on.


{{< hr3 "For starters, I want to say that there's nothing wrong with you." >}}


Sure, you be suffering from some form of mental illness and yes, you are very much an addict - but that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you per-say.

If you can still breathe, if you can still eat, sleep and move your arms and legs - then you are fine. 

The fact that you're alive, conscious and reading this signifies that there is nothing wrong with you.

Which is to say that being an addict isn't the end of the world. It's just a hurdle you're going to have to learn to overcome. 

Essentially, the problem is that you're not functioning effectively because you have an addiction.

And that's really all there is to know about it.


{{< hr3 "Which is also to say that all those aspects which you believe are wrong with you are due to your porn addiction." >}}


So to go back to our first question, are you actually addicted to those extreme fetishes you watch?

Well for the time being, yes, because you are a porn addict and that's what you've trained your mind to like.

However, what this also means once you overcome your porn addiction, you no longer will be thinking about those fetishes, because you won't be thinking about porn at all. 

Once you begin to realise that most of these problems are due to your addiction to porn, it also provides you with hope that once you overcome your addiction, most of these problems will go away.

Part of the problem with porn addicts is that they can only think in terms of being addict. They can't empathise with what it's like not to be addicted, and so they're completely oblivious to a whole range of potential outcomes.


{{< hr3 "Of course, these outcomes are only possible given one very important aspect that most people overlook." >}}


That you actively work on your mental health throughout this process of recovery, and commit to your daily routine of meditation.

Because while your porn addiction is the problem, removing that porn addiction from your life is only one-half of the solution.

The other half is replacing those negative behaviours with positive ones so that you're actually living your life to the fullest. 

So to answer the second question, do you have depression or is merely part of the recovery process? 

Well much like the first answer, yes you do have depression, however whether it is part of the recovery process is entirely up to you and how you decide to approach your recovery. 

If you do not actively work on your mental health, nothing will change and you will remain permanently depressed.

Of course, an interesting question people have is, well what about the positive aspects of who I am? Like my quirkiness and dark humour? Are they a result of my addiction and mental health?

In a lot of ways, it is - but it's not a symbionic relationship by any means. 

Which is to say that I'm just as quirky and as fun and as retarded as I was prior to my addiction. 

None of that has changed since I've overcome my addiction. Instead, what's happened is that I've merely gained new abilities to control my mind. 


So in summary, you are not your addiction.

So let's get back to basics and talk about what "functioning effectively" actually means.

It means doing things which are counter-productive to your growth as a human being. It means going against  -->
