<!-- Nearly finished. -->

I always find it interesting when I talk to people and they tell me that they don't have a mental health plan in place.

It's a bit like trying to navigate through a jungle without a map. You're going to get lost, relapse and probably die from dengue fever.

So many people try to 'wing it' because they think they know better, and it literally always ends the same way every single time.

Relapse.

Like, without fault.

So what exactly is a mental health plan?


{{< hr3 "Put simply, it's a strategy you have in place in order to help you stay on course with your task of developing Healthy Coping Mechanisms." >}}


Furthermore, it's going to help you verify what you know about yourself, as well as how you can improve in future upon that knowledge.

For example, do you have a strategy to help you deal with early morning urges? If not, then you're literally leaving your recovery to chance.

By not having a strategy which addresses your weak points, you're literally accepting that you won't have 100% certainty in how you will respond when faced with these compromising situations.

Not only the certainty of knowing well beforehand how you will respond, but the certainty to know that you will carry through with that reponse.

Often the thing that those recovering from porn addiction struggle the most with, is that they will continue to severely underestimate how difficult these compromising situations are.

They think "Well, I'm feeling okay now, so it couldn't possibly be that bad" and it's part of the reason why people continue to relapse again and again and again.

Preparation is the best form of abstinence, and aside from mentally preparing ourselves, another great way to prepare is by embracing a set of solid principles which can help guide us when we are feeling lost and clueless. 

For example, understanding that we must always aim to remain calm in all situations, and not react to our emotions and feelings even though they may feel unbearable at times.

This is why I created The Five Fundamental Prinpicles of NeverFap Deluxe which have been designed to help us serve this purpose, and instil those principles into us.

Ultimately, when you don't have a mental health plan you will usually fail to remain aware of the pitfalls of recovery, which merely leads to unnecessary relapse and confusion. 


{{< hr3 "So what does a mental health plan usually contain?" >}}


Well, at a bare minimum it should contain a consistent routine of meditation, as this is arguably the most important thing you can do for your mind from a mental health perspective.

Ultimately, a solid mental health plan should equally be about preventative maintenance, as it is should be about how to best to address difficult situations.

And that's really what meditation is about, helping you remain in balance so you don't even get to a point of experiencing urges, because you're already in-control of yourself.

Your plan should also contain a list of actions and strategies to help you deal with a bunch of common scenarios you struggle with.

For example, you may really struggle with boredom or stress when it comes to dealing with your urges, and so even identifying those situations can go a long way towards mentally preparing you for those situations well-ahead of time.

Of course, a key thing to understand about your porn addiction recovery journey is that there really is no silver-bullet when it comes to overcoming porn addiction.

I mean, sure.

Meditation is that silver-bullet for a lot of people, in a sense that it's such an all-encompassing skill which provides people with a huge amount of leverage in terms of allowing them to developing control over their minds. 


{{< hr3 "However it doesn't negate the amount of conscious effort required to remain calm during those uneasy situation." >}}


In fact, a huge issue most people face is that they will practice the exercises without truly applying them when the going gets tough, which is really no better than doing nothing at all.

Because that's really what effective porn addiction recovery is about. It's about being able to make those difficult, conscious decisions when we are most vulnerable.

So essentially, our mental health plan comes down to a few different things:


- Your Preventative Plan i.e. Your daily meditation/self-care routine
- Your Reactive Plan i.e. How you should respond in difficult situations
- Your Fundamental Principles which help guide you in general


And really, if you can manage those three things, you honestly will have done more than most people who will have attempted to overcome their porn addiction. 

And the significance of this really cannot be understated.

In summary, your mental health plan is your roadmap for change. Without it, you severely limit your ability to respond effectively and therefore you limit your future outcomes.
