Today I want you to think about this concept of "struggle".

Because it's a concept porn addicts seem all-too-familiar with, prominently as an all-consuming aspect of their daily lives.

We struggling with our feelings and emotions. We struggle with the people in our lives. Which causes us to struggle with the basics, like deciding whether we're even going to wake up this morning.

Well, this is why it's important that we approach this topic in a meaningful way, so we can truly understand the dynamics behind why we struggle. 

So we can choose healthier alternatives that empower us. 

And that's really what's so amazing about NeverFap Deluxe. It's about teaching us to think in empowering ways that make life easy, not arduous and difficult. 

What people often fail to understand is that struggle does not have to be a part of the recovery process, if you choose to play it smart.

In fact, I would argue that it's almost impossible to overcome porn addiction if you're struggling with it, which is why it's important that we address it now.

So what is struggle?


{{< hr3 "If I had to elegantly summarise struggle as an idea, I would say that struggle is a reflection." >}}


What does this mean? 

Essentially it means that struggle is a reflection of you. 

When we typically think about struggle, we think about the thing which we are struggling with. You know, it could be a really hard maths problem we're trying to solve or perhaps it could be plain life itself. 

We struggle with the thing, and then immediately we begin to question the struggle as a form of rationalisation i.e. Unhealthy Coping Mechanism. 


"Am I stupid? Why am I so dumb? How the hell do I do this thing!?"


Ultimately, reason why we do this is because we fail to understand the dynamics of the situation. 

Which is to say that the situation doesn't meet our expectations, and so we try and rationalise what might be wrong. 

This kind of behaviour is nothing more than instinctual habit we've learnt over the years. Which is to say that struggle is not only a way of thinking, but a pattern we've personally learnt and developed. 

So what's the alternative then to this questioning and rationalisation?

Well, it can first help to understand that struggle is a conscious decision. As it's a behaviour, it's a choice you consciously make in that moment to react. 


{{< hr3 "Which is to say that you're solely responsible for your struggle and how that makes you feel, not the activity itself." >}}


It's a bit like being stuck in quick sand. You can either choose to struggle with it, which means to fight it and sink further, or you can choose instead to relax and calm down, remaining in place until you can get help. 

Afterall, you're not effective without a calm mind.

And this really brings us to the alternative to struggle, which instead is to let go and simply be present with your feelings and emotions, without working yourself into a frustrated panic.

Part of the reason why so many people struggle comes down to society and this idea of being goal-driven.

We set ourselves these goals and expections, with doesn't help us to full appreciate the process. 

When we set ourselves the goal of "This will be the last time I ever masturbate and watch porn" and we struggle with that goal, our immediate reaction isn't to adjust our expectations. 

Instead, we merely try and reinforce these expectations, which merely leads to frustration, failure and hopelessness.

What I'm asking you to do instead is focus on the process, which means focusing on your feelings. 

This means learning to remain calm. 

Why?

Because process is king, and struggling doesn't help us meet our goals efficiently.

The great irony of struggle is that when you focus on outcomes, in particular the struggle you're experiencing, you actually achieve less than if you were to focus on the process. 

And you know the funniest thing of all? Struggle itself is nothing more than a perception. 

You perceive that you're struggling based on the expectations you have about who you are or where you should be in life. 

When really, there's nothing wrong with you or you capability to deal with the situation. You're simply dysfunctioning without truly realising it.

In a sense, this is why it's important to focus on ourselves and how we are personally responding when we're struggling, rather than on the task at hand. 

When we say we're struggling to learn advanced mathematical concepts, what we're really saying is that we personally have difficulty with mathematical concepts.

In no way does this struggle reflect the difficulty, or perhaps even the absurdity of mathematics as a subject.

As I stated earlier, it reflects you and how you decided to respond to your own self-perception.

What can help is to make a list of all the things that you personally feel like you struggle with.

And to try to understand how you contribute towards that struggle. 

Perhaps you get frustrated because you feel as if the task shouldn't be as difficult as you envisioned. Perhaps you're struggling due to the time it's taking, and your refusal to accept that. 

Regardless, I hope you have a more complete picture of what it means to struggle.

So that you can struggle no longer. 

Just remember that it essentially comes down to letting go and learning to let go of these expectations, so we no longer have to feel as if we're inadequate or incapable.

Until you do that, literally nothing will change and you will continue to struggle.
