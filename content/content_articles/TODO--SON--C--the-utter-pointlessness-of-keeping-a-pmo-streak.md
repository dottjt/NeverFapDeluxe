<!-- Half completed -->

I've spoken about PMO streaks in the past in **What Does It Mean To Relapse** and to summarise, they don't meaningful contribute towards our recovery.

In fact, they help cultivate self-defeating mindsets which do nothing to empower us, nor help us develop Healthy Coping Mechanisms, which is where the bulk of our focus and effort should be.

Well, today I would like to elaborate on this a little further, as it's mindset which I believe is toxic, no different to believing that it's okay to edge to porn or that self-criticism is healthy.


{{< hr3 "So what exactly is a PMO streak?" >}}
 

Well, a PMO streak is when you keep count of the days since you last relapsed. It's essentially a reference to how long you haven't masturbated for. 

For starters it's a meaningless figure. 

The amount of days you've managed to refrain from relapsing is absolutely no indicator of your mental health, nor whether you've truly developed control over your mind or not during that period.

Especially since a lot of these streaks can be circumstantial, where the only reason why you managed to reach 2 weeks was because you happened to be away on vacation. 

And yet inspite of these conveniences, people will hold these streaks as gospel, as if it's a firm indicator of their ability to refrain from porn.

As NeverFap Deluxe states, it's perfectly easy to get 30 (or even 60) days without a strategy or solely using Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms, but to truly get 90+ days and beyond requires a solid foundation of Healthy Coping Mechanisms.

And when you fixate your attention on these meaningless figures, this inevitably leads to helplessness when people lament at how they've never been able to reach previous streaks, inspite of trying harder than ever. 

Of course, like all things in life, there's a strong sense of duality to these streaks which manages to rope people back. 

Because people will argue that they also can serve as a motivator, as something to get excited about you do manage to get further and further along.

I suppose the question I pose to these people is why would anyone put so much faith in a metric that not only has no connection to developing solid mental health practices, but which equally takes away from you and makes you feel awful once you do slip up?

In fact, it's part of the awful cycle of guilt and shame which comes with relapsing, 

Oh, and that's another thing that's come about as a result of these streaks, is that it gets people obsessed with this idea of relapse, which leads to all sorts of incessant rationalisation.


"Is it relapse if I edge to porn for an hour but don't orgasm?"

"Is it relapse if I masturbate without porn?"


All questions which have precisely zero relevance to the fundamentals of developing control over our mind and learning to become more resilient and more empowered human beings. 

All because they're trying to justify this streak which they have deemed to be the sole source of truth to their recovery, as they completely disregard any amount of mental health practice instead. 

And this really highlights how PMO streaks are so much than a mere figure, and instead ends up entrenching itself as a way of thinking about recovery.

Which itself becomes a huge distraction from meaningful change.


{{< hr3 "At the same time, I don't blame people." >}}


When you don't have a solid strategy in place, it's easy to become desperate and begin relying on raw hope. 

So what's the alternative? 

Well, the alternative is to simply refrain from keeping track of your relapses, at all.

Keeping streaks is a bit like picking your nose or saying 'um' after each sentence. It's just bad habit, that serves no real purpose to your recovery. 

If you really want a reference, I would suggest writing down the day you last relapsed, and then forgetting about it completely. 



<!-- MOVE TO TOP. -->

Of course, people try to justify it by claiming that maintaining a streak can help motivate you and that it's something to feel proud about. 

Which I don't disagree with, but on the flipside it can also demotivate you significantly if you do end up relapsing.

Although my main criticism is that you can just as easily feel those things without any of the downside.


Addiction recovery is not a game of exclusion. It's a game of active participation and change.

Change which can only come from practice and consistency in all areas of our life.
