<!-- One last edit -->

I've written about PMO streaks in the past in **What Does It Mean To Relapse** and to summarise, they don't meaningful contribute towards our recovery.

In fact, they help cultivate self-defeating mindsets which do nothing to empower us, nor help us develop Healthy Coping Mechanisms, which is where the bulk of our focus and effort should be.

Essentially, anything which takes our focus away from the process of recovery is merely a distraction from effectively improving each day.

Well, a PMO streak is when you keep count of the days since you last relapsed. It's essentially a reference to how long it's been since you last watched porn or masturbated.

It seems to be a very common theme within the porn addiction recovery community, as an important metric to gauge the success of how well someone is doing with their recovery.

When really it's nothing more than a meaningless figure.

The amount of days you've managed to refrain from relapsing is absolutely no indicator of your mental health, nor whether you've truly developed control over your mind during that period.

Especially since a lot of these streaks can be entirely circumstantial, where the only reason why you've managed to reach 2 weeks was because you happened to be away on vacation or because you were sufficiently distracted for a period of time. 

And yet inspite of these conveniences, people will hold these streaks as gospel, as if they're a firm indicator of what they're actually capable of.


{{< hr3 "As NeverFap Deluxe states, it's perfectly easy to get 30 (or even 60) days into a streak without a strategy or solely using Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms." >}}


But to truly get 90+ days and beyond requires a solid foundation of Healthy Coping Mechanisms, something which these streaks do not convey in any way.

And when you fixate your attention on these meaningless figures, it inevitably leads to all sorts of problems.

One of the biggest problems is the perception of hopelessness people will conjure at the fact that they haven't been able to reach their furthest streak in years, inspite of trying harder than ever.

Which makes people feel helpless and demotivated, merely hindering their recovery further.

Of course, people try to justify these streaks by claiming that counting the days can actaully achieve the opposite of this, and in fact help you and motivate you and provide you with a sense of pride. 

Which I don't disagree with, but on the flipside it can also demotivate you and significantly put you off course, and so why should we continue to put so much faith in a metric that not only has no connection to developing solid mental health practice.

But which equally takes away from you and makes you feel awful once you do slip up, especially when there are a host of wonderful alternatives which simply don't do this?


{{< hr3 "In fact, it's a huge contributing factor towards this awful cycle of guilt and shame which comes with relapsing, which I'm sure we're all familiar with." >}}


Oh, and that's another thing that's come about as a result of these streaks. People will become obsessed with this idea of relapse, which leads to all sorts of incessant rationalisations.


"Is it relapse if I edge to porn for an hour but don't orgasm?"

"Is it relapse if I masturbate without porn?"

All questions which have precisely zero relevance to the fundamentals of developing control over our minds, nor helping us learn to become more resilient and more empowered as human beings. 

All because they're trying to justify this streak which they have deemed to be the sole source of truth to their recovery, as they completely disregard any amount of mental health practice instead. 

And this really highlights how PMO streaks are so much than a mere figure, and instead ends up entrenching itself as a way of thinking about recovery.

Which itself becomes a huge distraction from meaningful change.

The amount of times I've seen someone write "I keep relapsing after a couple of days, I can barely make it a week anymore, someone please help me!" really is a key indicator of how we allow these metrics to define us. 

At the same time, I don't blame people.


{{< hr3 "When you don't have a solid strategy in place, it's easy to become desperate and begin relying on raw hope." >}}
 

So what's the alternative? 

Well, the alternative is to simply refrain from keeping track of your relapses, and instead to stick to solid principles instead which empower us simply by way of thinking. 

Keeping streaks is a bit like picking your nose or saying 'um' after each sentence. It's a bad habit and that serves no real purpose to your recovery. 

What can help instead is to focus your attention on what you managed to achieve for that day. 

Not only does it place emphasis on your immediate actions, which are essentially the only things which matter to your recovery. 

But it's also a really empowering way of thinking about success and achievement, which doesn't make us feel as if we haven't done enough.

Often what's most helpful is to simply remain neutral and not have an opinion on the progress of our recovery. 

This will help us most in terms of being able to dissolve all feelings of judgement, worry or self-criticism we may about ourselves or our recovery.

Of course, ultimately at the end of the day these are all merely tools for us to utilise and appreciate. 

In your case, it may even be as simply as writing down the day you last relapsed, and then forgetting about it completely. 

Regardless, the point of this article is that there are somethings which aren't worth doing and which severely hinder our ability to recover.

And maintaining and glorifying these streaks is one of them.
