I've spoken about my opinion on PMO streaks in **What Does It Mean To Relapse** as a largely counter-productive way of viewing your porn addiction recovery. 

Today I would like to elaborate further on why, as it's arguably the reason why 90% of people are failing to get anywhere with their recovery.

It is absolutely toxic and it needs to end today.

As I state on NeverFap Deluxe, everything you do needs to come back down to developing Healthy Coping Mechanisms and in no way does maintaining a PMO streak do that. 

Therefore, it is an Unhealthy Coping Mechanism because it is merely a distration from meaningful change. 



What's the alternative? If you really want a reference, I would suggest writing down the day you last relapsed, and then forgetting about it. 




Of course, people try to justify it by claiming that maintaining a streak can help motivate you and that it's something to feel proud about. 

Which I don't disagree with, but on the flipside it can also demotivate you significantly if you do end up relapsing.

Although my main criticism is that you can just as easily feel those things without any of the downside.


Addiction recovery is not a game of exclusion. It's a game of active participation and change.

Change which can only come from practice and consistency in all areas of our life.
