<!-- Half completed -->

I've spoken about PMO streaks in the past in **What Does It Mean To Relapse** and to summarise, essentially they add nothing to our recovery. 

In fact, they help develop self-defeating mindsets which do nothing to empower us, nor help us develop Healthy Coping Mechanisms which is what our primary concern should be.

Well, today I would like to elaborate on this a little further, as it's mindset which I believe is toxic, no different to believing that it's okay to edge to porn or that masturbating without porn is okay.

Well, a PMO streak is when you keep count of the days since you last relapsed. It's essentially reference to the number 

The first problem is that it's a meaningless figure. 

The amount of days you managed to refrain from relapsing is absolutely no indicator of your mental health, nor whether you've truly developed control over your mind during that period.

Especially if it's circumstantial, where the only reason why you managed to reach 2 weeks was because you happened to be away on vacation. 

As NeverFap Deluxe states, it's perfectly easy to get 60+ days with Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms but to truly get 90+ days and beyond requires a solid foundation of Healthy Coping Mechanisms.

The problem however is that people don't realise this, so they actually do treat these streaks as gospel, which inevitably leads to helplessness when people lament at how they've never been able to reach previous streaks.

Inspite of the fact that those streaks were entirely circumstantial, and in no way a reflection in any capacity of whether they are truly recovering or not.

When we don't have a solid strategy in place, we become desperate and we start doing things which aren't effective, yet are all we know. 

The second problem with PMO streaks is that once they become entrenched as a way of thinking, they become a huge distraction from meaningful change.

Instead, we begin placing emphasis on our streaks, 


So what's the alternative? 

Well, the alternative is to simply refrain completely from keeping track of your relapses, at all.

Keeping streaks is a bit like picking your nose or saying 'um' after each sentence. It's just



If you really want a reference, I would suggest writing down the day you last relapsed, and then forgetting about it. 






Of course, people try to justify it by claiming that maintaining a streak can help motivate you and that it's something to feel proud about. 

Which I don't disagree with, but on the flipside it can also demotivate you significantly if you do end up relapsing.

Although my main criticism is that you can just as easily feel those things without any of the downside.


Addiction recovery is not a game of exclusion. It's a game of active participation and change.

Change which can only come from practice and consistency in all areas of our life.

Talk about alternatives.
