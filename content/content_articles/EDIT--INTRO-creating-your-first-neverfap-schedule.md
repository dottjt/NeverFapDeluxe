Everything in life revolves around practice.

No matter what you want to do in life, practice is the means through which we master something.


{{< hr3 "Practice is what will allow us to overcome porn addiction." >}}


And what you practice is absolutely vital.

In the case of overcoming porn addiction, this means practicing the core skills involved to help you regain control over your mind.

Anything else you practice outside of this, will not meaningfully impact your porn addiction in the same way that having control over your mind will.

And the only way this is going to happen, is if you have an effective routine of practice in place.

This means understanding why these practices are effective, finding the time to actually practice them and most importantly, doing these practices consistently.


{{< hr3 "To start out, I recommend spending approximately 10 minutes per day practicing observation." >}}


Specifically, the <a class="link" href="https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/observe-your-senses">Observe Your Senses</a> practice which explains how to do this in the most simple way possible.

Observation truly is the most fundamental practice you can do in terms of  developing your awarenes, and it is the practice we ask that you commit to every single day.

In part because observation should form the fundamental basis of everything you do.

From how you think to how you perceive the world around you.


{{< hr3 "It's more-or-less the only exercise I personally do." >}}


In part because I've already spent years doing all those other practices, and they're now less meaningful now that they're engrained into my head.

Whereas because observation is what I would consider "a default state of mind" is something which we need to continually develop on a daily basis.

Certainly, while those other practices are incredibly useful in developing new perspectives, they are merely supplementary.

The aim is that once you feel you have a grasp of <a class="link" href="https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/observe-your-senses">Observe Your Senses</a>, you can start adding additional exercises to your routine.


{{< hr3 "Personally speaking, I don't recommend doing more than one additional exercise at a time." >}}


Which is to say that an ideal routine will consist of doing <u>Observe Your Senses</u> along with one other additional exercise.

Usually it makes sense to commit to these additional exercises for a week, before switching to something else.

Just because doing it only for a day, won't teach us very much in terms of how changing the way we think will truly affect us long-term.

But of course, finding out what personally works for you is important as well.


{{< hr3 "My Personal NeverFap Routine" >}}


I have a very basic routine which works really well for me.

Essentially, I spend around 40 minutes each day towards developing my awareness.

With a few small key points throughout the day where I periodically zone out and just embrace calm.

Here's how I would break it down:


<hr class="hrul"/>

- 15 minutes of meditation as I walk to the train station in the morning for work.
- 15 minutes of meditation as I walk to the train station in the morning for work.
- 10 minutes of meditation while sitting down in a room, around 15 minutes before bed.

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>


This is the routine that I personally find works superbly well for me, in part because I don't need to necessarily go out of my way to make it happen.

I've simply adapted meditation to my everyday life, and that's what I recommend you do as well.

In almost all cases, I am practicising observation of some kind, although usually encompassing different variations.

I may focus on a very particular sense.

In other cases, I may simply focus on emptying the thoughts from my mind.


{{< hr3 "Regardless, I keep it super simple and that's why it works." >}}


Another thing to consider is self-care.

Ultimately, the reason why NeverFap works as a solution is because the core philosophy behind it is quite simple.

And self-care is simply another aspect we can focus on, to make things even simpler.

Certainly, this isn't a focus of NeverFap Deluxe, so you can certainly do your own research into this.

However below is a list of what I personally do to maintain self-care in my life.


<hr class="hrul"/>

- I eat paleo.
- I do cardio and lift weights three times a week.
- I have a consistent sleep routine.
- I work on my hobbies and ambitions in my spare time.
- I play video games and watch TV to relax.
- I meditate approximately three times a day.
- I work a typical nine-to-five job.
- I brush my teeth in the morning and at night.
- I have a cold shower every night.

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>


The extent to which you maintain self-care is entirely up to you.

In any case, I hope this post has helped you better understand what you can expect from a consistent NeverFap Deluxe routine.

I encourage you to start small and simply commit to 10 minutes of meditation each day.

That's precisely how I started and to be quite honest, spending 10 minutes each day was enough for me to see significant changes in the way I thought over the space of a few weeks.

So don't feel as if you need to commit all your time to doing this.

Remember, it's not how much you practice that counts, but what you practice that matters.

In particular, if you feel as if you're struggling to find time to commit to your mental health, I highly recommend reading my article <a class="link" href="https://neverfapdeluxe.com/articles/you-always-have-time-for-your-mental-health">You Always Have Time For Your Mental Health</a>
