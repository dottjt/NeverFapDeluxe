<!-- Will Need One Edit -->

This article aims to explore the idea of what it means to have the mindset of someone who does NeverFap.

The thing I love most about NeverFap is that it's designed to make addressing your porn addiction easy.

On a very low level it's about learning to co-exist with your emotions, in order to both avoid experiencing porn cravings altogether, as well as remain neutral when they do arise.

And when you're not taking anything personally and you're not allowing any external influences from changing the way you think and feel...

Well, I couldn't possibly think of anything more effortless than that. 

I truly believe that successful porn recovery requires an effortless approach in order to be effective, which is why I have designed NeverFap to be as effortless as possible. 

If I had to use one word to describe what NeverFap encompasses.

I would use the word:


{{< hr3 "Calm." >}}


Calm is the default NeverFap state of mind. 

It's not about being excited, determined or ready to dominate the world with your new-found energy.

Those things will not help you sustainably overcome porn addiction.

Instead, it's about being calm.

When you practice the NeverFap Deluxe exercises everyday and apply them to your life, it makes you feel calm and collected. 

In large part because when you practice these exercises which provide you with the required skills and abilities to control your mind, you no longer fear the unknown.


{{< hr4 "Because you know that you have a strategy in place, and you know exactly what to expect from your ability to address your addiction." >}}


Another part of the reason why being calm and collected is important, is because it becomes really difficult to self-harm or react emotionally when you're feeling calm.

In fact, it becomes almost impossible.

Which is exactly what we want, and is part of the reason why calmness is so wonderful within itself. 


{{< hr3 "Because remaining calm doesn't require any effort." >}}


In it's truest sense, calmness itself is a lack of effort.

Calmness is the result of letting go of all your thoughts and simply just being. 

Ultimately, it's only possible not to be calm if you're actively doing something to disrupt it.

Whether it be obsessive thinking, feeling or judging - all these things serve to disrupt our default state of being calm.

Of course, you may struggle to remain calm because you've built this habit of obsessively thinking and judging everything around you.

That's okay too.


{{< hr3 "It's simply a matter of following your daily routine of NeverFap Deluxe Practices." >}}


By commiting to meditation and practices which teach you self-control over your mind, you're making changes to how you think and feel.

And the longer you commit to practicing each and everyday.

The more you change and the closer you get to experiencing completely calmness in your life.

So what are you waiting for?

<!-- 
Often, our level of calmness is any single situation is usually a good indicator of our mental health at the time. 

If we're feeling tense and stressed, then it's likely that we're reacting or experiencing judgement in some way, shape or form.
