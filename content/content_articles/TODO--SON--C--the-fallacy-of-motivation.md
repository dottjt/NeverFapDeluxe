There are a lot of misconceptions out there in regards to the porn addiction recovery process, and today I hope to discuss one of the more common misconceptions that people have.

Which arguably is a misconception that has probably plagued everyone at some point during their journey.

The misconception we will be talking about today relates to motivation. Specifically, motivation as a driving force for change.

It's a huge misconception because relying on motivation is probably one of the most common reasons why people end up struggling with their porn addiction recovery for so long.

So let's dive a bit deeper into why.

The primary problem with motivation is that it's not a solid principle, which is to say that it's something which fluctuates.

A lot of people develop this idea that if they can build up enough motivation, and furthermore maintain that motivation, then they'll be able to succeed with their goals.

The problem is that it's literally impossible to sustain consistent motivation, which is why everyone who pursues motivation as a coping mechanism always ends up relapsing.

The reason why is because based on this logic that motivation is the means through which you push through. Therefore, without motivation, there is no reason

Instead, what we should be doing is learning to develop self-control inspite of how motivated we are, and this is why NeverFap Deluxe places such a strong emphasis on process.

Only through a process of practice and consistency can we overcome our feelings and levels of motivation, which are constantly fluctuating for one reason or another.

People assume that it's about feeling happy and motivated - which is what the end result will be, but it's also detached from the actual process itself.

Instead, it's about learning to be resilient and mentally balanced

In other words, being happy and motivated is not a substitute for balance itself.

Yes, you are those things when you are balanced, but they are not balance itself.


If I truly had to describe motivation as a coping mechanism.


I would describe motivation as a poor man's process.


Not only because your process is now conditional based on how you're currently feeling, but because it doesn't guarantee anything.

It's a very indirect way of saying "I need to motivated so I don't relapse" as opposed to saying "I won't relapse inspite of how I feel".

Because the fact is, bad things happen. Sometimes you have days that are completely out of your control.

I suppose the question I pose to people who value motivation so much is: "Why give this one aspect so much power over your outcome?"

And of course, you shouldn't. No one should.

It's this kind of thinking which traps people into these cycles of helplessness, where they wonder why the ended up relapsing, inspite of all the effort they spend

Oh, and that's another thing to mention. Constantly trying to keep yourself motivated and trying to manipulate your emotions is tiring.

To a point that all it takes is one slip up to have it all go to waste.

Listen, there's nothing wrong with feeling motivated. It's a great feeling. But relying on it is only going to end in disaster.

Instead, we're all about developing self-control so that we can be effective regardless of how we feel.
