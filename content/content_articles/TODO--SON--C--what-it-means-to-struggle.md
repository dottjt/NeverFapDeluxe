<!-- This should actually be an article explaining what it means to struggle -->
Today I want you to think about this concept of "struggle".

After all, it's quite a common concept if you're an addict
It could be with your own emotions. It could be with certain people in your life. It could even be with a number of daily tasks you still haven't quite mastered. 

The intention is to identify these pain points, in order to then address them in some meaningful way.

This exercise really signifies the importance of awareness as a tool for change.

Essentially, we cannot meaningfully change if we cannot first identify what may be wrong. 

Furthermore, it's a great way to understand how we think in relation to our perceived problems.

Here's the thing about struggle.

Struggle is a two-sided interaction, in that it's a choice you consciously make.

It's a bit like being stuck in quick sand. You can either choose to struggle with it, which means to fight it and sink further, or you can choose instead to relax and calm down, remaining in place until you can get help.

In essence, the point I'm trying to get at is that struggling is a choice which doesn't help us meet our goals, at least effectively.

You see, the only reason why you think 



In other words, this concept of struggle is nothing more than a perception. 

When we say we struggle to learn advanced mathematical concepts, what we're really saying is that we personally have difficulty with mathematical concepts.

In no way does it reflect on the difficulty, or perhaps even absurdity of mathematics as a subject.

Please keep this in mind as you do this exercise, and really try and explore the thoughts and feelings associated with your personal struggles.

In this exercise, what you want to do is list all the things that you personally struggle with.

It could be something to do with your porn addiction. It could be related to a perception you have. It could be related to your inherent ability, or lack thereof.

Try to think of all the things you struggle with, and then try to list how those struggles make you feel.

Do they make you feel angry or frustrated? Do they make you feel helpless, perhaps even guilty or jealous?

Again, this is your own personal experience with reality, so how you feel in relation to struggle is entirely personal to you.
