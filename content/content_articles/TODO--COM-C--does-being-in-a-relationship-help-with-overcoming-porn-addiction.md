People often ask me whether being in a relationship helps with overcoming porn addiction.

In fact, a lot of people are somewhat sold on this idea that they won't be able to overcome their porn addiction unless if they're first in a relationship.

Where they're receiving that love and attention, as well as participating in physical sex on a regular basis.

With a lot of people attempting to give up porn in order to get themselves in a relationship.

I've decided I want to write about this, because the answer varies significantly depending on your point of view and why you've decided to overcome your porn addiction.

Firstly, I want to say that being in a relationship can help with your porn addiction, however how you might it understand.

It begs to state right off the bat that it has absolutely nothing to do with sex. Regular sex has absolutely nothing to do with overcoming porn addiction, and in most instances is actually a detriment to your recovery.

Especially if you're still orgasming during sex.

Rather, a relationship can be helpful in the sense of having someone you're close to, who you're comfortable talking about these issues with, so they can support you through your recovery.

No different to family and friends.

And a key part of making this work is first telling them that you have a problem with porn.

Secondly, I want to say that being in a relationship is by no means at all necessary for you to overcome your porn addiction.

Ultimately, what matters is sticking to your mental health routine of meditation and awareness, as that's what is going to make those physical changes in your mind.

Part of the problem with porn addiction recovery, is that a lot of people are doing it for the wrong reasons.

For example, they're using it in order to try and find a partner.

While there's nothing wrong with seeking a partner, it detracts from the focus of what we're trying to achieve with our porn addiction recovery.

Which is to say that what we're trying to achieve is improved mental health so you can have the opportunity to do whatever you like.

What a lot of people don't understand is that being in a relationship is simply a consequence of having proper mental health, not the goal itself.

Only once you have your mental health down-pat, will your ability to pursue relationships become effortless.
