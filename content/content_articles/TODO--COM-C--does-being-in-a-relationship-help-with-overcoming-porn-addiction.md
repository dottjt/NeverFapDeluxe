<!-- ENDING NEEDS FINISH -->

People often ask me whether being in a relationship helps with overcoming porn addiction.

In fact, a lot of people are somewhat sold on this idea that they won't be able to overcome their porn addiction unless if they're first in a relationship.

However, this is a self-destructive way of viewing recovery, one which is both completely understandable (as that's how I personally felt to a large extent) and which can be addressed through an improved understanding of the dynamics of recovery. 

So let's begin.

In absolute terms, it absolutely can.

Being in a healthy relationship can be an incredibly positive thing, not only to have someone to confide in and be honest with, but to actually support you with your goals when the going gets tough.

Not because being in a relationship has anything inherently to do with porn addiction, because healthy relationships are healthy. 

So what does support mean in the context of a healthy relationship? It means having someone who understands you with love, empathy and care. 

What doesn't it mean? Well, it definitely has nothing to do with sex, and this is where most people go wrong. They assume that by having regular sex with a person that they'll no longer have the desire to watch porn, however this couldn't be further from the truth.

For starters, porn has nothing to do with sex. It is a raw addiction, no different to craving cigarettes or heroin. You will crave porn irrespective of whether you are having sex or not.

Although porn addiction appears to largely be a sexual issue, at its core it really is a mental health issue - and sex has nothing to do with mental health, at least within the context of porn addiction.

The primary reason why it won't help you with your porn addiction is because at the end of the day, overcoming addiction comes down to developing control over your mind, and having sex will not help you achieve that goal.

Instead, it merely serves as a distraction. No different to binge eating or escaping your problems.

The problem is that you don't know how to effectively use your mind. Sex won't solve that.

On the other hand, having another person to understand your condition and learn to love you unconditionally, may help you with that goal. 

Of course, there's a few things you must do in order for your significant other to help you.

This is often the hardest problem and it took me close to five years to truly admit the extent to which I was struggling. 

Although I'd spoken to her about it, I wasn't truly honest with her and I felt like I was actually hiding a part of myself behind my addiction.

But the moment I told her ...wow. It was like I'd lifted a huge burden from my shoulders, and actually, it wasn't until this point that my recovery become relatively easy.

To no longer feel the sense of guilt and shame that I used to feel about myself, was astonishing. I felt truly free for the first time in years, and it was incredible.

Although soemthing to keep in mind is that being in a relationship is by no means at all necessary for you to overcome your porn addiction.

Ultimately, what matters is sticking to your mental health routine of meditation and awareness, as that's what is going to help you make those physical changes in your mind.

Of course, if you're still sold on this idea you absolutely must be in a relationship to be satisfied in life, here's a great tip that a lot of people don't reality.

Only once you have your mental health down-pat, will your ability to pursue relationships become effortless.

But instead what happens, is that people find themselves in these traps of believing that being in a relationship will help solve all their problems

The problem is that people place so much emphasise
