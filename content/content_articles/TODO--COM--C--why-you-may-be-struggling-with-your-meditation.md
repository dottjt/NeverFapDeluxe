Today we're going to talk about meditation.

In particular, the ways people struggle with meditation because it turns out I was doing it wrong for years, which arguably set my recovery back ...well, years.

When I started out on my porn recovery journey I was meditating 30 - 40 minutes per day, and ultimately it make zero difference at all to how I was feeling.

Which is why I stopped it for so long, only to return to it with a new-found appreciation, which essentially revolutionised absolutely everything I know about porn addiction recovery today

Of course, part of the reason why I failed to understand meditation was also in part due to severe mental health issues I was dealing with.

However even inspite of those issues the whole concept never really made much sense to me, only that it was something that apparently was good for you.

Like, I never experienced that 'wow' moment where I could actually see and feel the purpose of it.

Well, chances are that you may be experiencing the same thing.

For starters, a lot of NeverFap Deluxe assumes that you have a lot of the rest of your life already sorted.

Like, you're eating healthily, you're exercising frequently, you're working on yourself and you're geniunely motivated to want to do this.

Obviously if you're eating junk food every night, getting stoned on a daily basis or you're abusing yourself in other ways, then meditation alone isn't going to help you significantly.

So here are just some common sense tips which you might find useful.

This is probably the first mistake most people starting out with meditation make.

While meditating with your eyes closed is a perfectly valid way to meditate, I would certainly not recommend it for people starting out with meditation.

Meditation ultimately is about actively engaging your mind and for those new to it, closing your eyes is the perfect way to just fall asleep instead.

Furthermore, it's a lot easier because our vision is what helps us connect with reality, and so to remove that sense makes it incredibly difficult to focus on reality itself.

This is another one of those things which people do, which is a HUGE no-no. 

{{< hr3 "Meditation is a form of observation." >}}

The other issue is that meditation is often explained really poorly to people, even by professionals.

What often happens is that these so-called 'experts' will explain it as 'emptying your mind' or 'focusing without thought' and it's blatantly incorrect.

Well, not incorrect, just incredibly misleading from a processes point of view.

Yes, it is about 'emptying your mind' but that's merely a by-product of having successfully practiced meditation. The issue is that saying what it is doesn't explain how to actually do it.

Instead, it's actually about observing your senses and once you understand that, then everything becomes super easy and you'll find yourself naturally emptying your thoughts without thinking about it.

I've written about the process extensively in this article

The purpose of meditation.

The purpose of meditation is quite simple - it's an effective way to help balance you.

And that's really all there is to it. By meditating you can easily maintain balance, which brings a HUGE number of benefits.

This is also why it's usually more benefitial for people to meditate frequently throughout the day, rather than with long 30-40 minute sessions.
