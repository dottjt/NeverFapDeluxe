Today we're going to talking about some of the ways which people struggle with meditation.

Personally speaking it turns out I was doing it wrong for years without realising it, which arguably set my recovery back ...well, years.

In a lot of cases, it's because we completely misunderstand the purpose and intention of meditation, and so we end up practicing meditation with all the wrong ideas in mind.

I know when I was starting out with my own porn recovery journey, I was meditating 30 - 40 minutes per day and it literally made zero difference to how I was feeling at all.

Hell, I wasn't even doing it to overcome porn addiction persay, I was just doing it because apparently it was just a "healthy thing" to do, and so why the hell not?

Of course, with this mindset I never truly understand the purpose of meditation, and so I stopped doing it for a very long time, only to return to it with a new-found appreciation later on down the track.

Which essentially revolutionised absolutely everything I know about porn addiction recovery today, so let's explore this a little bit. 


{{< hr3 "Why meditate?" >}}


Meditation serves one purpose, which is to help you maintain balance.

It's not designed to make you completely invulnerable to experiencing urges, nor is it designed to turn you into metaphysical perfection.

It's simply a useful tool which can help recalibrate your mind to being calmer, focused and more aware of itself. 

Which is great, because these traits are ultimately what allow you to cope more effectively in life without feeling as if you need to resort to porn to express that.

In fact, remaining calm and collected within itself becomes the coping mechanism, and that's truly a wonderful thing.

Because you then realise that you're able to get through life without suffering or putting yourself into compromising situations, and that within itself is hugely empowering.

Of course, part of the reason why I failed to understand meditation was also due to severe mental health issues I was dealing with at the time.

Not to mention, the whole concept never really made much sense to me. Like, I never experienced that 'wow' moment where I could actually see and feel the purpose of it.

Well, chances are that you may be experiencing the same thing and that's cool too. We all have to start somewhere. 

For starters, a lot of NeverFap Deluxe assumes that you've already sorted out a lot of the rest of your life.

Like, you're eating healthily, you're exercising frequently, you're working on yourself and you're geniunely motivated to want to do this.

Obviously if you're eating junk food every night, getting stoned on a daily basis or you're abusing yourself in other ways, then meditation alone isn't going to help you significantly.

So with that in mind, here are some fundamental principles which you might find useful.


{{< hr3 "Don't meditate with your eyes closed." >}}


This is probably the first mistake most people make.

While meditating with your eyes closed is a perfectly valid way to meditate, I would certainly not recommend it for those starting out with meditation.

Meditation ultimately is about actively engaging your mind and for those new to it, closing your eyes is the perfect way to disengage and just fall asleep instead.

Furthermore, it's a lot easier to meditate with our eyes open because our vision is what helps us connect with reality, and so to remove that makes it incredibly difficult for us to focus on engaging with reality itself.

One thing you'll notice as well is that it actually takes quite a lot of effort to leave your eyes closed, compared to leaving them open.

But yeah, make it easy for yourself and leave them open.


{{< hr3 "Don't meditate lying down." >}}


This is another one of those things which people do, which is a HUGE no-no.

Much like how you shouldn't close your eyes during meditation, we're not trying to simulate sleep. Instead, we're trying to actively engage our mind, and so lying down simply does the opposite to that.

I think the reason why people do this is because they struggle with meditation because can't figure out how to actually quiet their mind, so they assume if that by lying down they're actually meditating more effectively.

However that's really no different to tiring yourself as coping mechanism not to masturbate, it simply isn't healthy, nor does it actually teach you self-control.

Instead, you really should be sitting up with a straight back, with your body as relaxed as possible.


{{< hr3 "Meditation is a form of observation." >}}


Perhaps the primary reason why people struggle is because of the fact that meditation is often explained really poorly to people, even by professionals.

What often happens is that these so-called 'experts' will explain it as 'emptying your mind' or 'focusing without thought' and it's a bit like describing a book as 'pages with words' or 'a physical narrative'.

It doesn't actually capture the essence of what meditation is actually about, especially from a process point of view. 

Sure, on some fundamental level it is about 'emptying your mind' but that's merely a by-product of having successfully practiced meditation. Describing the end-result doesn't actually explain how to do it.

Instead, it's actually about observing your senses and once you understand that, then everything becomes super easy and you'll find yourself naturally emptying your thoughts without thinking about it.

Since meditation is about actively engaging your mind, it can help to think of your senses (that is your sight and your hearing etc.) as an extension of this and so by focusing on these areas, we can easily practice meditation without thinking about it too much. 

Furthermore, when you think about it this way, meditation actually becomes incredibly easy.

Like, our senses are something that we can all relate to. Everyone can relate to the feeling of touch, but the feeling of an 'empty mind'? Not so much.

Of course, I'm sure there are a lot of different ways with which we can struggle with meditation, and this is not an exhaustive list by any means. 

I mean, for a lot of people it simply comes down to feeling fearful of what might happen once they reconnect with their mind on a fundamental level. For a lot of people, they've never actually done this, as they've merely become so accustomed to distracting themselves, that it's all they know. And so it can be scary.

Regardless, there are a heap of different resources as part of NeverFap Deluxe to help you out.
