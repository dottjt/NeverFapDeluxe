This is a bit of a silly question, because the quality of sex you have in life bears no relation to the state of your mental health.

However, it's still a common question I get from people, so I thought I may as well write about it.

Essentially, it's great.

Like, think of the sex that you imagine you're having while watching porn and masturbating. Well, I can happily say that it's significantly better than that, in almost every way.

And usually it takes around 90+ days to finally get to that point of sensual pleasure.

Maybe you can't get hard. Maybe you can't finish. Maybe you finish too soon.

Maybe it's even a combination of the above.

While porn can definitely play a huge part in affecting your ability to perform during sex, often the reasons why you're struggling are external to your porn addiction itself.

For example, if you haven't had much sex at all, you're going to be terrible with it. Like, don't expect to finish the first few times, let alone get hard very easily. You're simply inexperienced.

Sure, porn makes it worse. But porn isn't the only reason in this scenario.

In a lot of cases it might be because you simply don't have a connection with the person you're having sex with.

That's also super common as well.


{{< hr3 "Personally for me, the way porn negatively impacted my ability to have sex was due to the false standards of women I'd developed from watching porn." >}}


it warped my understanding of what sex was as this highly visual, dopamine-driven experience, as opposed to this activity of love and connection.

And I suppose that's the biggest thing you'll notice once you fully recover from your porn addiction.

You'll realise that sex has nothing to do with what the person looks like. It has to do with their presence and the love you feel for that person.

And as a result, the sex will be a lot of better and certainly, a lot more meaningful.

Of course, if you're pursuing sex for purposes outside of love and connection, then don't be surprised if it kinda sucks.

At least that's been my own personal experience, as well as the experience of almost everyone I've talked to.

I think a more interesting side-effect I've noticed from abstaining from porn, masturbation and orgasm overall, is that my desire to have sex has probably decreased.


{{< hr3 "Not in any inherent way, but because it's simply not my focus in my life." >}}


Instead, my focus is to help others and self-improve as an individual, and NeverFap Deluxe allows me to do that.

And I think this really signifies the beauty of NeverFap Deluxe as a philosophy in life.

Essentially, it allows you the freedom to choose how you want to live your life, and how you want to use all that additional energy from abstaining and having proper mental health.

You can use it to pursue women if you want and have a heap of sex. Maybe you're more interested in productivity and business. Really, that's entirely up to you.

I am merely the guide afterall, and the NeverFap Deluxe website and what you're currently reading is a by-product of what you can achieve when you finally have control over your mind.
