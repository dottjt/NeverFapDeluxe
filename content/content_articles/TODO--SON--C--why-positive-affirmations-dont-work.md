<!-- Will need an edit -->

I'm going to begin this article by saying that positive affirmations are an Unhealthy Coping Mechanism.

It's one of those things which everyone thinks is positive and helpful, when really it's quite destructive when you focus on the fundamentals.

Another similar belief that sets people up for failure long-term is thinking that porn addiction recovery is about keeping yourself as busy as possible, when really this is a huge misconception that leads itself to all sorts of unhealthy attitudes. 

And certainly, I don't blame anyone. 

When all you have to go by are your existing coping mechanisms, which at this point includes masturbation to deal with stress, then most people don't have a lot to work with.


{{< hr3 "So let's talk about the dynamics behind positive affirmation, so you can fully understand why they don't work as a Healthy Coping Mechanism." >}}


As a brief reminder, part of what makes Healthy Coping Mechanisms effective is that they help you develop control over your mind.

Usually by helping us become more aware of ourselves, as well as by assisting us on an emotional level by helping us remain calm and collected.

Positive affirmations do neither of those things. 

Instead, positive affirmations are a form of emotional manipulation, and here's how it usually plays out.

You discover that your mind is uncalm on some level. 

You're not feeling particular happy with yourself, you're not feeling motivated, perhaps you're even feeling a little anxious or depressed.

So instinctually, you tell yourself it's simply because you need to be positively affirmed. 

So you start watching some funny YouTube videos. Maybe you try and read some motivational quotes. And it kind of makes you feel okay for a small while, but instantly you return back to how you were feeling before. 


{{< hr3 "So a small part of you decides to panic. You begin worrying about the fact that you're still down, which inevitably leads to self-criticism." >}}


"Why can't I just be happy? Why is it so hard to be motivated?"

And part of you thinks that maybe it's because your positive affirmations weren't strong enough. You know, because watching more YouTube and trying to feel more inspired, is going to work, right?

So you get yourself even more pumped, but then obviously it fades away and you end up feeling worse about yourself, because now you're feeling even more self-critical and hopeless than you did before. 

Repeat this a few times, and you can understand why people end up relapsing, inspite of doing what they thought was the right thing.


So there's a few reasons why positive affirmations don't work.

For starters, they don't actually do anything to address the actual problem, which is that your mind is uncalm and has lost balance.

In fact, the term 'positive affirmation' is actually a lie. In reality it's nothing more than a distraction. When you go and watch YouTube videos or seek any sort of affirmation to address how you feel, you are merely distracting yourself from your feelings.

At best it's a form of escapism.


{{< hr3 "You seeking any kind of affirmation is the exact opposite to remaining calm and collected." >}}


So why do we do it? As always, we do it because we don't know better.

It's like what our parents and peers did, based on the beliefs and agreements we developed as a child.  

In most cases, the agreement goes a little something like this. 

My current feelings and emotions are undesirable, therefore I'm going to expose myself to positive and empowering agreements in order to make myself feel better.

Which sounds great in theory, but that's not how emotions and feelings work.

And in order to change these habits and how we understand how they work, we need to address the underlying belief. 


{{< hr3 "An important thing to note about belief is that it exists irrespective of whether it's functional or not." >}}

Furthermore, that function exists irrespective of belief.

And in fact, humans often function a lot more efficiently without belief, which is to say that we can be happy irrespective of what we believe about happiness. 

Belief is just an abstraction on-top of that, which is why we place such a strong emphasis on dissolving things like expectations and rationalisations, so we can keep our minds free from distraction.

I'll have to write about this another time, as to why belief itself can be such a huge drain, and in particular because it requires a huge commitment for us to actually believe something.


In other words, so we can keep our minds balanced, so we don't even get to a point of having an uncalm mind.

To truly highlight the absurdity of these agreements within the context of positive affirmations, it can help to create your own agreements with the same logic. 


"In order to be happy, I'm going to do ten jumping jacks, twenty push ups and run around clockwise for twenty minutes."


Now it becomes even more absurd when you change the condition. "In order to become sad..." "In order to become angry..."

Now you could say that I'm making it absurd, but the ultimately absurdity here is that you don't need to do anything at all in order to experience an emotional state.

You just need to acknowledge that you want to feel something, in order to feel it, and that really is the point of this article. 

That affirmations are merely an abstraction on-top of feeling itself, because we haven't been taught to think otherwise. 

So to come back to the original point of this article, the alternative to positive affirmations is to not have any affirmations at all.

Instead, it's about learning to remain calm and aware of yourself.
