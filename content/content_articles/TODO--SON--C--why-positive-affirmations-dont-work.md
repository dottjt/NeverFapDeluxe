It's funny how what you think you know is correct can actually be blatantly incorrect, and positive affirmations is one of those things.

The important thing to note about our existing coping mechanisms, is that we don't often do them because they work. We often do them because that's all we know, and certainly positive affirmations are one of those coping mechanisms.

Perhaps it's how our parents and friends tried to console us when we're feeling down, or maybe it's simply you've seen other react in regards to helping themselves.

Regardless, I'm here to tell you why positive affirmations don't work well as a coping strategy, as well as what you can do instead in order to cope more effectively.

why positive affimrioant don't work, it's a bit like saying that everytime you want to be happy, you need to do ten jumping jacks, eat a candy baar etc. it's absurd
