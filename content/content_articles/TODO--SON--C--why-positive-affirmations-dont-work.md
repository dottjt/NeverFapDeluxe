I'm going to start off by saying that positive affirmations are an Unhealthy Coping Mechanism.

It's one of those things which everyone thinks is positive and helpful, when really it's quite self-destructive.

No different to how people have this perception that porn addiction recovery is about being as busy as possible, when really this is a form of distraction therefore sets us up for failure long-term. 

Which is cool, because all we literally have to go by are our existing coping mechanisms, which is most cases have been ineffective up until now, which is likely why you've been struggle with porn addiction for so long.

I'll put it bluntly. 

No different to willpower and motivation, positive affirmations don't work as an effective coping strategy.

Like, at all. 

So let's explore this in greater detail so you can develop a clearer picture as to why this is the case.

The reason why they don't work comes down to this concept of agreements (commonly known as beliefs).

The whole premise behind why we make positive affirmations, is because most of us have been taught to think in terms of making agreements, and making positive affirmation is one of the ways with which we reinforce them.

In most cases, the agreement goes a little something like this. 

My current feelings and emotions are undesirable, therefore I'm going to expose myself to positive and empowering agreements in order to make myself feel better.

I mean, it sounds great, right?

Well, the interesting thing to note is not so much the logic or rationale behind the action, but the underlying contract we've actually created. 

What we're essentially saying is that if we do X we will feel Y, irrespective of whether this is even true or not.

But we don't notice that. We simply create the belief, and we pursue the belief, put simply because that's what we believe. 

Belief is irrespective of whether something works or not. At this point, we've merely speculated what we think might work, due to belief alone. 

Because the alternative is actually just to be happy without belief, although I'll get to that in moment. 

Regardless of whether what we believe is true, ultimately what's important to understand is that agreements don't work as an effective coping mechanism.

Positive affirmations is merely one set of agreement




why positive affimrioant don't work, it's a bit like saying that everytime you want to be happy, you need to do ten jumping jacks, eat a candy baar etc. it's absurd
