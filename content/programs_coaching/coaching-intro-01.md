I offer porn addiction recovery coaching for those seeking more targeted advice from someone who's been there before.

In most cases, the articles and resources on this website should provide you with all the knowledge necessary to help you overcome your porn addiction.

However, it can be difficult to do alone.

As outlined in <a class="link" href="/articles/my-personal-porn-recovery-journey/">My Personal Porn Recovery Journey</a> one of the big things which helped me overcome my porn addiction was coming out to my partner about my mental health issues.

Which obviously is impossible if you don't have anyone you can trust. I've certainly been in this position before and I can understand what it's like.

It's also part of the reason why I run an <a class="link" href="https://discord.gg/YETRkSj">#accountability program</a> on our Discord Server, so users can receive that level of interaction with other people without feeling judged.

Not to mention, a large part of the reason why I offer personal coaching is due to the simple confusion of interpretation. 

Am I meditating correctly? Am I truly maintaining balance? What does it mean to let go? Why do I keep relapsing? Why do I always end up distrusting the process after a few months?

All questions I can personally answer.
