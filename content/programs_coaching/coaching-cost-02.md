There are a few steps to this process in order to ensure you're receiving the most value out my services.

### All clients begin with a FREE 10 Minute Consultation so we can discuss how I can best help you.

This is in order to establish an initial relationship, as well as to gauge whether you require personal coaching at all. 

Perhaps you might only have a few questions on your mind. Perhaps you may decide that you require on-going assistance. 

Usually it becomes quite obvious whether you'll require additional coaching, and it's precisely why it's important that we have this initial meeting.

Because I speak to so many porn addicts each day, it doesn't take me very long to figure out what a person's problems are, as well as what is required for change.

I can immediately tell if it's going to take a person years to beat this thing because of their inherent refusal to trust the process (usually as a result of excessive cynicism).

I can immediately tell if they're going to struggle with meditation because of their inability to let go of their own thoughts and emotions.

I've been through this process a thousand times before. Not only because I've personally been there, but because it's what I observe on a daily basis.

Regardless, I'm more-than-happy to help and provide assistance.


### I then charge $90 per hour for any on-going sessions that you feel are necessary.


During these on-going sessions will we cover a wide range of topics, depending on what you require help with. 



<!-- However, for the particularly stubborn (certainly I was one of them) on-going sessions can be helpful to keep you on track and have someone tell it to you straight.

In almost all cases, the issue with stubborn clients is that they'll refuse to stick to the routine, and then complain about relapsing as if they could have never seen it coming.

Ah yes, the great veneer of denial, sticking out it's ugly head as it cackles at you like a murder of crows. Been there before. It sucks. I totally get it. Let's change that.

You distrust the process. You lose. It's that simple. I've said it a million times before, and I'll say it for another million if I have to. -->
