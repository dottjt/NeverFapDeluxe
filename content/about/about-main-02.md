While everyone is aware of the NoFap movement, no one actually seems to be able to effectively explain how to achieve NoFap with any sort of coherence or consistency.

Most of the materials I could find online ranged from various theories on how to manage porn cravings and emotions using ineffective and unhealthy coping mechanisms.

To personal advice from existing porn addicts who's opinion seemed to change depending on the day of the week, as per their unpredictable schedule of relapse and mania.

I mean, you wouldn't trust financial advice from someone with a gambling problem, so why should you treat your porn addiction recovery any differently?
