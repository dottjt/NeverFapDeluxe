NeverFap Deluxe Practices focus solely on verifiable steps you can do on a daily basis to help you build awareness and calmness.

At a bare minimum you should be meditating everyday, usually for 10 minutes before bed (at least that's what most people find easiest, myself included).

To be quite honest, 100% of the actual recovery process in terms of effective change is nothing more than meditation.

However, because humans are silly and will refuse to commit (not to mention, we do silly things like get addicted to porn), I've dedicated a good 85% of this website towards convincing you why you should commit.

With the other 15% actually focused on meditation exercises and practices.

That's because convincing you to actually treat your mental health seriously is 85% of the battle. It's the primary thing most people struggle with, otherwise you wouldn't have become a porn addict within the first place.

Regardless, here are some exercises that I recommend.
