The absolute most important thing for you to do to ensure success in your porn addiction recovery, is to begin developing a solid mental health routine that you can commit to everyday.

This will primarily include a daily routine of meditation which you will practice, without fail, every single day for the rest of your life.

This practice should be considered basic maintenance, and should be treated no different to brushing your teeth everyday. If you stop, then literally everything will fall apart and unfortunately it takes people years to figure this out.

Respect your time.

Thankfully NeverFap Deluxe contains a heap of different resources to help you develop your meditation.

A good place to start is with the <a class="link" href="/accounts">NeverFap Deluxe Meditations</a> page which covers a range of different resources and approaches towards meditation.

At a bare minimum you should be meditating everyday, usually for 10 minutes before bed (at least that's what most people find easiest, myself included).

Here is a basic summary of those resources.
