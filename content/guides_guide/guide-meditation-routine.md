The absolute most important thing you can do to ensure success with your porn addiction recovery is to begin developing a solid mental health routine that you can commit to everyday.

This primarily will include a daily routine of meditation which you will practice without fail, every single day for the rest of your life.

No different to brushing your teeth every single day, this practice should be considered basic maintenance on a very fundamental level. 

Because you know what happens once you stop brushing your teeth? 

They begin to develop cavities and you end up developing gum disease, which is not only going to be painful in the long-run but complete detrimental to your health overall.

### Your mental health is no different.

Too many times I've seen people practice meditation for a few weeks, only to stop because they think they've reached "balance", immediately falling back into their old habits within a matter of days.

Thankfully NeverFap Deluxe contains a heap of different resources to help you develop your meditation routine, so you can learn to remain consistent and not fall into these traps of situational complacency.

A good place to start is with the <a class="link" href="/meditation">NeverFap Deluxe Meditation</a> page which covers a range of different resources and approaches towards meditation.

At a bare minimum you should be meditating everyday, usually for 10 minutes before bed (at least that's what most people find easiest, myself included).

Here are some resources to help get you started.
