Once you have the basis of your mental health strategy all sorted out, the next thing we are going to do is put in place a system of accountability that is designed to not only get us excited about recovery, but also help us keep on top of the healthy coping mechanisms we will be practicing everyday.

In order to do this, we will be posting a daily journal into the NeverFap Deluxe Discord <a class="link" href="https://discord.gg/YETRkSj">#accountability</a> channel.

Can't be bothered?

Well, that's the reason why it takes 5 years on average of people to overcome their porn addiction. You distrust the process, you lose the game. It's honestly that simple.

Furthermore, it's a great opportunity to see what everyone else is doing in terms of their healthy coping mechanisms, as well as understand the steps they're taking on a daily basis to get 90+ days with their progress.

Another great thing about <a class="link" href="https://discord.gg/YETRkSj">#accountability</a> is that it's a tight-nit community. Because we're small, you get the care and attention you deserve and I always respond to direct messages sent to me.

Oh, and let's not forget the acknowledgement process! We acknowledge each other's journal entries with emojis, which as we all know, is largely why the internet was invented.
