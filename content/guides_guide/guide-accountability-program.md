The next thing we are going to do is put in place a system of accountability that is designed to not only get us excited, but also help us keep on top of the healthy coping mechanisms we practice everyday.

In order to do this, we will be posting a daily journal into the NeverFap Deluxe Discord <a class="link" href="https://discord.gg/YETRkSj">#accountability</a> channel.

Can't be bothered?

Well, that's the reason why it takes 5 years on average of people to overcome their porn addiction. You distrust the process, you lose the game. It's honestly that simple.

Furthermore, it's a great opportunity to see what everyone else is doing in terms of their healthy coping mechanisms, as well as understand the steps they're taking on a daily basis to get 90+ days with their progress.

Another great thing about <a class="link" href="https://discord.gg/YETRkSj">#accountability</a> is the tight-nit community we have on the channel. Because we're small, you get the care and attention you deserve and I always respond to messages within 24 hours.

Oh, and let's not forget the acknowledgement process! We acknowledge each other's journal entries with with emojis, and it's a great motivator to see that other people are following the same journey that you are.
