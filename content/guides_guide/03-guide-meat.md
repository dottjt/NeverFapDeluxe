If you haven't yet had the chance, I highly recommend that you check out the <a class="link" href="https://neverfapdeluxe.com/">NeverFap Deluxe Homepage</a>.

It explores in great detail what you can expect from NeverFap Deluxe, as well as serve as a fantastic introduction into some of the skills you'll be learning from the materials on this website.

Following on from the homepage, there are essentially two core skills we must learn.


{{< hrg "The first skill is <u>awareness</u>" >}}


Awareness relates to your ability to remain conscious.

In other words, your ability to navigate your mind in order to pursue healthy coping mechanisms. Ultimately, it is what will allow you to assert control over yourself.

In fact, your awareness is the reason why you're reading this paragraph, because at some point you made the conscious decision to do something about your porn addiction.

Of course, just because your mind is conscious, doesn't mean that you've developed the ability to think consciously all the time, let alone when your emotions have gotten the better of you.

No different to hitting the gym, only by practicing awareness can we learn to snap into consciousness at the worst of times, and therefore pursue healthy coping mechanisms without difficulty.

Awareness is your ticket out of this mess. It is your capacity for conscious action and your core mechanism for maintaining civil accountablity over your actions.

It will be key to your success.


{{< hrg "The second skill is <u>calmness</u>." >}}


Calmness is your ability to remain relaxed.

It is an important ability to have because in 99% of situations it will be your go-to healthy coping mechanism for dealing with mentally challenging situations.

In fact, it will be your go-to.

Period.

You should always aim to remain calm and calculated, as that will allow you to be at your absolute most effective. Primarily, because we are at our most conscious when our mind is calm.

Which is to say that our ability to exert control over ourselves is at our highest when we are calm, which makes dealing with cravings and other potentially disruptive feelings an absolute piece of cake.

Calmness is what makes things easy.

You want this to be easy, right?


{{< hrg "<u>Meditation</u> is how we will be developing these skills." >}}


Why meditation?

Because meditation teaches us both awareness and calmness at the same time, which is precisely why it's so powerful in terms of teaching us to adopt healthy coping mechanisms.

Furthermore, it's an incredibly simple process, which is vital when we already have limited conscious awareness to begin with.

Honestly, all it takes is 10 minutes of meditation per day in order to develop sufficient control over your awareness and calmness.

It's one of the easiest and most impactful investments you can ever make towards your mental health.

It will change your life.

<!-- Meditation is a way of thinking. Once you get it, everything makes sense. -->


{{< hrg "Well actually, there is a third skill <u>Ambition</u>." >}}


Ambition is everything else once you've mastered awareness and calmness.

Ambition is more a social expectation in terms of helping you thrive in society, rather than an actual requirement in terms of assisting you in maintaining your happiness and well-being.

Something which is designed to enhance your life, but still remain secondary to awareness and calmness.

It's part of the reason why I don't place a heavy focus on ambition, nor give it much attention.

In general because it's something that will come naturally to you once you master your awareness and calmness, so you've got that to look forward to as well.

It's simply the cherry on top of the cake.

Not the cake itself.
