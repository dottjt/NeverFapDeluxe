Coming to the realisation that you're a porn addict, as well as making the decision to overcome your porn addiction is arguably one of the most profound things you will ever do.

It will completely change the way you feel, think and perceive on every level.


{{< hr3 "But only if you're willing to trust the process." >}}


What does this mean?

It means challenging yourself with new ideas you may outright disagree with, and which may not make any sense to you at all for a period of time, inspite of the effort you spend practicing them.

It means rejecting and ignoring your human instincts, as well as accepting that everything you know about yourself is not only incorrect, but the primary reason why you're addicted to porn.

It means committing to your daily routine of meditation, even when your mind is convinced that it's unnecessary because you've managed to remain mentally stable for a couple of weeks.

It means acknowledging how truly dire and self-destructive your current habit is, as a very serious form of self-harm which you have normalised as a viable solution to your problems.

For a literal number of years up until now.


{{< hr3 "In essence, it means distrusting yourself." >}}


Because up until now, you've put so much trust and faith into lying to yourself and supporting your addiction, that you're no longer able to identify what's truly wrong with you.

Which is to say that you're in denial.
<!--
And I am being deadly serious. -->

You're in denial because you continue to masturbate to porn inspite of how much you hate it, inspite of how rotten it makes you feel, as well as how much it is destroying you in almost every single way.

It takes a considerable level of denial to allow oneself to self-harm to this extent, and it is an incredibly serious condition no different to having a severe mental illness.

Acknowledging that you're in denial is the first step towards initiating positive change.

Because although we may have good intentions at heart, when we fail to recognise that we're in denial, we can only continue to repeat and strengthen these self-destructive behaviours, time and time again.

Denial which causes us to distrust our recovery processes, because we fail to recognise how truly harmful these behaviours are.

The same kind of denial that pedophiles and murderers use to justify their actions, because they feel comfortable with their own reasoning and logic, regardless of the consequences.

Just as you have until now.


{{< hr3 "This is why it takes up to 5 years on average for people to overcome their porn addiction." >}}


Because they remain in denial about their problems, without truly realising the extent to which they maintain this facade.

Well, I'm here to break the cycle.

Understand that the sole reason why people relapse and lose control of themselves, is because of a decision they've made at some point to distrust the process.

Perhaps they thought they'd be fine skipping out on their routine meditation for a couple of days, because they were comfortable with the level of mental health they'd achieved up until then.

Perhaps they failed to maintain their awareness because they thought it would be okay to act with excessive judgement in a particular situation, because "that's just what everyone does".

Perhaps they decided to continuing working past their designated nightly cut-off time because they decided in this one particular instance, that it was okay to put their work before their mental health.

All behaviours which outright neglect the sanctity of our commitment to the addiction recovery process.

Behaviours which inevitably lead to compromised positions where we find ourselves no longer able to control our thoughts and emotions, because our minds have lost balance.

Behaviours which leave us truly terrified, when we realise that we've left ourselves with nothing more than our hesitation in order to deal with our difficult feelings and emotions.

Behaviours which almost always result in relapse and an all-too-familiar sense of dread and disappointment.

You distrust the process. You lose the game.

It's that simple.


{{< hr3 "On the other hand, if you commit to the steps you are 100% guaranteed to succeed." >}}


There is absolutely no doubt about it.

No different to hitting the gym everyday, if you work out consistently you will put on muscle and you will become strong.

You can ignore it. You can fear it. You can tell yourself it's not worth it, or that it won't work for you. You can even claim that weakness is a superior attribute, and that exercise is a form of self-harm.

It really doesn't matter what you think. In no way does your opinion change the fact that consistently lifting heavy weights in the gym will improve your strength.

Your mental health is no different.

If you practice meditation everyday and work on your awareness, you are guaranteed to become more in control of your thoughts, feelings and emotions over time.

The process doesn't lie.

I mean, it's just a process after all.

A series of steps which have been designed to help you improve as you take them one step at a time. It really doesn't get anymore simple than this. Trust the process and you will succeed.

Of course, I'm not expecting you to trust the process immediately.

People will tend to distrust the process a few times, also known as the process of trial and error. But that's really up to you and how you choose to reason with your own denial.


{{< hr3 "Most commonly, the reason why people end up distrusting the process is because they eventually believe that they're somehow above it." >}}


For example, they may reach a point of being so mentally stable for so long, that they assume that they can just go back to old habits without being affected by it, as if they've become permanently cured.

This is not how processes work.

For example, you can't just eat once and be done with it. You need to eat every single day in order to sustain yourself, and your mental health should be treated no differently.

You need to be practicing meditation and other awareness exercises every single day, not because you're inherently messed up, but because it's a normal, healthy thing to do.

Of course, if you're not already dedicating time towards any amount of self-maintenance, then even the slightest commitment may seem excessive for some people.

When facing these kinds of dilemas, it can help to remember that you're in denial, and that what you're feeling is always unreasonable and needs to be challenged.

I know when I started out, I found it immensely difficult to convince myself to find even 5 minutes to dedicate towards meditation, because I viewed it as a huge waste of time, if not a burden to my schedule.

Yep, I was a tough nut to crack.

Certainly, you'll have the opportunity to come to the same realisations that I did throughout my journey, given I'll be teaching you the same healthy coping mechanisms that I've also adopted.

Which is a key thing to note, because as a collective we're all ultimately going to experience the same emotions and feelings of recovery.

The same initial feelings of doubt. The same overwhelming feelings of elation once we discover the power of meditation. The same feelings of empowerment once we gain full control over our emotions.

The same end result of being happy, confident and entirely porn free without even a hint of hesitation.

Not because I believe in your inherent ability to succeed.

But because I understand the incredible power of process as a driving force for permanent change, regardless of who you are or where you've come from.

The process is your best friend.
