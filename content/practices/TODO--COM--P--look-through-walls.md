The idea behind this exercise is to teach you to think of your senses differently.

As humans are limited by our sense in the rawest sense. We can only see, feel and hear so far. 

What this exercise helps us do is imagine what it would be like to be able 

Not only will it help you better understand your existing senses and their limitations, however it will help you to better imagine your life overall.


{{< hr2 "Instructions" >}}

For this exercise we want to pretend as if we can see through walls.
