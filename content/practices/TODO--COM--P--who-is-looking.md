This is arguably one of the hardest exercises you can do.

Certainly, it's an exercise that I continue to struggle with and perhaps will never truly understand.

Of course, this isn't to say that it isn't useful as a thought exercise. More that it's an exercise that can tend to produce more anger and frustration, than enlightenment.

Although, that's also part of the challenge. Learning to deal with our emotions when faced with something that may not make a whole lot of logical sense.

Part of the reason why it's difficult is because it's a thought exercise that has no definite answer. Furthermore, it works on such a high conceptual level that it's a bit like asking someone to picture a cube in 4D.

At best, it's mind-boggling.

However, accepting the imperfection of this process is also part of the process itself, so I encourage you to stick with it - even if it ends up driving you insane.

For this exercise I want you to think about your mind and your consciousness.

Now, who or what is 'looking' and perceieving. 

Does your consciousness derive from your eyes and your visual field? Rather, is it somewhere deeper, like your brain?

Where do you feel your consciousness emanate from most? Is it from your bodily sensations, or your mind? Is there a difference?
