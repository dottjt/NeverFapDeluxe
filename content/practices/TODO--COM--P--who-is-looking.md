This is arguably one of the hardest exercises you can do.

Certainly, it's one I continue to struggle with, a) because it has no definite answer and b) simply because it works on such a high conceptual level that it's literally impossible empathise with.


Ultimately, it's about understand the cloud of sensation that is human consciousness. 

{{< hr2 "Instructions" >}}

I want you to think about your mind and your consciousness.

Now, who or what is 'looking' and perceieving. 

Does your consciousness derive from your eyes and your visual field? Rather, is it somewhere deeper, like your brain?

Where do you feel your consciousness emanate from most? Is it from your bodily sensations, or your mind? Is there a difference?
