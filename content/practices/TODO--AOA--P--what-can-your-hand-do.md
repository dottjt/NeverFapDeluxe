This exercise is designed to help you think outside of the box.

It's not a particularly difficult exercise in the sense that it allows for unlimited creativity, however by the same token it's almost impossible to master.

I find I consistently learn new things each time I try this exercise, and you'll be surprised at the extent to which you'll discover new things.

What we'll be doing with this exercise is come up with a number of ways we can use our hands.

By doing so, we can truly realise the extent to which we haven't been thinking before. 

It's a lot like when you walk down a street you're familiar with, and you happen to notice something completely new that's always been there, yet you hadn't noticed up until that very moment. 

By practicing this exercise we can learn to not only think creatively, but also understand that no matter how much we think we know, we don't truly know it all. 

Something which often has to be seen to be believed.

To begin this exercise I want you to first look at your hand. 

What do you see? Take notice to the wrinkles on your knuckles. The hair on your fingers. The tone of your skin.

Already, you're probably doing something unique. Chances are you may have never considered staring at your hand for an extended period of time, ever. 

Next try and move your fingers around. See if you can make your hand into weird shapes by moving your fingers into odd positions. What happens when you move your wrist as well.

Once you've played around with that idea, get your other hand involved as well. 

What arrangements/combinations can you create with two hands? What if you interlace all your fingers together? What if you put both the backs of your hands together?

Remember, this truly is an exercise of creativity, so the aim is to play around and see what you can come up with.
