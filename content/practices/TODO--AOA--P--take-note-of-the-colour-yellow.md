This is another classic awareness exercise which can help us develop our focus and attention.

By classic, I mean it's another variation of the tried-and-true observation exercises on this website, which has you noticing something odd or particular throughout the day.

For this particular exercise we're going to take inspiration from our surroundings and focus our attention on the various colours we see throughout the day.

In particular, we're going to focus our attention on the colour yellow.

That's right kids!

For this exercise what we're going to do is notice whenever we see the colour yellow.

How you decide to do this is up to you. You can write it down. You can simply acknowledge the fact in your head.

The real benefit from this exercise comes from how you choose to remain calm throughout the day.
