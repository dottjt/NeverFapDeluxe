<!-- Basics, done -->

<!-- {{< hr2 "Context" >}} -->


The idea behind this exercise is to start thinking about how we struggle. 

And the way we do this is by first identifying what may be wrong, for if we can't identify what is wrong, then we can't say for certain that there is anything wrong to begin with. 

Nor where we should even look in the first place in order to address the issue we may be experiencing.


{{< hr3 "The important thing to understand here is that struggle is a very personal concept." >}}


And in most cases, is a reflection of how we feel about ourself, rather than a reflection of the thing we're struggling with.

In other words, this concept of struggle is nothing more than a perception. 

When we say we struggle to learn advanced mathematical concepts, what we're really saying is that we personally have difficulty with mathematical concepts.

In no way does it reflect on the difficulty, or perhaps even absurdity of mathematics as a subject.

Please keep this in mind as you do this exercise, and really try and explore the thoughts and feelings associated with your personal struggles.

In this exercise, what you want to do is list all the things that you personally struggle with.

It could be something to do with your porn addiction. It could be related to a perception you have. It could be related to your inherent ability, or lack thereof.

Try to think of all the things you struggle with, and then try to list how those struggles make you feel.

Do they make you feel angry or frustrated? Do they make you feel helpless, perhaps even guilty or jealous?

Again, this is your own personal experience with reality, so how you feel in relation to struggle is entirely personal to you.
