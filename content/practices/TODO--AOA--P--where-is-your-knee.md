This is another one of those classic awareness exercises where we pay attention to some aspect of our reality.

They're classic because you've probably seen them a thousand times before on this website, but the reason I create them is because they're effective.

In this exercise what you're going to be doing is paying attention to the location of your knee.

The idea is nothing remarkable, yet it's an effective way for us to develop control over our mind and expand our capacity for awareness.

I suppose what makes this awareness exercises different to something like <b>Take Note Of The Colour Yellow</b> is that the focus is on some aspect attached to ourselves, rather than something which is external to us in reality.

And although it may seem like a small thing, it actually changes quite a lot in terms of focus.

No longer does it mean we need to seek for things in our reality and instead, it's more like a gentle reminder of some fact about yourself.

Regardless, it's a great way to engage the mind on a conscious level.

Throughout the day, take notice of your knee.

It can be as simple as a brief acknowledgement, or perhaps even look at your knee for a moment.

I know for a lot of people this can be a bit of a surreal experience, to take notice of this thing on our body which we've probably never thought about before.

What purpose does it serve? Are you grateful that you have a knee? Is it something which deserves the expression of gratitude?

All questions which can help you better understand yourself.
