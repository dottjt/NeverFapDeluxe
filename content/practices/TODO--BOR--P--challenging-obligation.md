This exercise is incredibly powerful. 

It's a very direct way to change how our mind works, and is an exercise that a lot of people find very challenging despite how simple it actually is. 

The idea behind this exercise is to challenge our beliefs and pre-conceived notions of what we believe is necessary.

In the previous exercise, what we wanted to do is first identify our obligations. 

In this exercise, what we want to do is directly disobey them.

For example, you may feel obliged to read your email at a certain hour, or to check our phone for messages.

What we want to do is not do that.
