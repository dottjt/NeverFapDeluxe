This exercise is incredibly powerful.

It's a very direct and physical way of changing how our minds works and as you'll find, this exercise takes a lot of inspiration from other exercises such as <b>Stop Absolutely Everything You're Doing</b> in a more reactive way.

Until then, I'd like to take a moment to talk about change.

The interesting thing about change is that people often assume that it's some kind of switch that flicks on in the back of your mind.

Which then sudden propels you into a life of doing and becoming.

Certainly, this kind of attitude culminates from a typical victim mindset, whereby we believe we are not responsible for the outcomes in our life.

Instead, what we want to do is focus on change as this idea which requires conscious output.

After all, that is essentially what we are aiming for with developing our capacity for conscious awareness with these exercises, so that we can increase our ability to act inspite of our existing dysfunction which we are trying to address.

And the thing which we are addressing is the current obligation that you feel not to succeed.



So in essence, this exercise is designed to help you change how your mind works and responds in regards to that sense of obligation you feel when it, and therefore a lot of people find very challenging despite how simple it actually is.

The idea behind this exercise is to challenge our beliefs and pre-conceived notions of what we believe is necessary.

In the previous exercise, what we wanted to do is first identify our obligations.

In this exercise, what we want to do is directly disobey them.

For example, you may feel obliged to read your email at a certain hour, or to check our phone for messages.

What we want to do is not do that.
