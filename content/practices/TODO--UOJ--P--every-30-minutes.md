The idea behind this exercise is to help us develop awareness.

Essentially the intention behind Every 30 Minutes is to keep a constant gauge of what you're doing throughout the day, so you can develop and follow routine.

Routine is a very important part of the recovery process, and this exercise is a way to streamline the process of developing the idea of routine.

In addition, it's a wonderful way to engage your brain and keep ontop of things.

Essentially, your aim with this exercise is to keep a mental timer to record or acknowledge what you're doing every 30 minutes throughout the day. 

In order for this to be effective, you will not to be using an alarm in order to keep record of when 30 minutes has passed.

An alarm is not a substitute for your own conscious awareness, which we are attempting to develop. 

Instead, what you will be doing is recording whether you remembered to write down what you were doing for that 30 minute period. 

I find it helps to do this exercise starting a time like 8:00am in order to keep it easier to keep track of each 30 minute segment.
