A lot of people find this exercise super useful, because it can help us identify our biases much easier than trying to identify those biases directly.

It's a great thinking exercise, which makes you realise how well optimised our minds truly are when it comes to filtering information. 


{{< hr2 "Context" >}}


Judgement by function is conditional.

We discover some sort of condition which triggers us to react, either negatively or positively.

For a lot of people, these triggers are aspects of their personality they're completely unaware of. 

Most judgemental people don't even realise they're judgemental, because it's such an ingrained aspect of who they are, that they assume it's all just some continuum of everyday thought.

In these situations, it can be very difficult to actually identify what is judgement and what is not. 

And so the purpose of this exercise is to help you make that distinction, by bringing to your attention the things which you don't feel compelled to be judgemental about. 

Which for a lot people, is a lot simpler than trying to identify the things which they feel passionately judgemental about.

In addition, it can help them understand more about themselves, by merely identifying the things which they don't care about.

The exercise is simple.

Your task is to think about the things you don't feel judgemental about. 

Things which you couldn't possibly care about, which don't evoke any kind of reaction.

Then once you've identified that thing, ask yourself why? Why doesn't that particular subject evoke a feeling? 

Why are you not attached to that particular subject?

For example, I'm not judgemental about medical surgeons. I have literally zero opinion on medical surgeons. 

Why? Well, I guess because I don't actually know any medical surgeons, and it's simply not a subject which ever enters my conscious. 

The key with this exercise is to progressively try to find subjects which you're not judgemental about, yet may be related to or have something in common with the things you are judgemental about. 

For example, you may feel judgemental about celebrities or politicians, but feel significantly less judgement about popular sporting figures.

Try and discover some common themes. Perhaps you might discover something. Perhaps you might not. 

We're all here to learn more about how our individual minds work.
