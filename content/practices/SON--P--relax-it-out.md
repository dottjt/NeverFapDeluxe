This exercise is incredibly effective, especially for those new to meditation and perspective.

Well, I'd go as far as to say that all exercises are effective, it's just that some are conceptually a lot simpler to actually do than others. 

{{< hr2 "Context" >}}

There are a range of different exercises which all seem quite similar to what we're attempting to achieve here.

This includes Slow it down, where we try and slow and speed up reality, as well as Stop it all, where we try to just shut our mind off completely.

With Relax it out, what we're essentially trying to do is simply relax into a situation, as opposed to consciously manipulation our interpretation of it.

An important thing to keep note of with these awareness exercises, is that what we're ultimately aiming to do is gain an intuitive understanding of how these different exercises make us feel. 

{{< hr4 "It can help to think of these exercises as a bridge to help you better understand your emotions." >}}

We're not necessarily trying to 'achieve' anything per-say. 

We're merely changing how we perceive and experience reality, and observing how we feel when we pursue them.

This is how you learn to gain mastery over our emotions. 

So whenever you're doing these kinds of exercises, remember to always try and guage how you feel.

{{< hr4 "If you skip this step, you'll gain very little from this exercise because you're not actively engaging your brain." >}}

If you don't engage your brain, then it physical changes won't take place on a low level, and subscequently your behaviours and habits will have a much harder time changing.

So ask yourself when doing the exercise:

Do you feel more comfortable when you relax? Is there anything you don't like about relaxing? How does it compare to other awareness exercises?

Remember, this is a process of self-discovery.

There are no right or wrong answers. 

There is only what you feel.

<!-- TODO: The ultimate aim of these practices -->

{{< hr2 "Exercise" >}}

For this exercise, what we want to do is relax and you can do this whenever you want. 

I personally find it's quite effective to engage in this activity while doing something, because it's arguably easier to relax when you're in a non-relaxed state, as opposed to sitting silently in a chair.

So what does it mean to relax?

Well, let's start with some of the physical attributes.

Relaxing from a physical perspective means letting go of all the tension in your body. It means slowing our pace and taking things easy.

Mentally speaking, relaxing is about experiencing without obligation or care. You just are. You don't have to worry about anything, because you know what? You're relaxed.  

Again, I urge you to remember that this is a process of self-discovery. 

I can describe all day what relaxation is, but unless if you attempt to practice it, you simply cannot effectively use it when required.

One key thing to understand is that relaxation is a feeling, so if you can't feel it on demand, then you won't be able to cope when you find yourself in a situation where you feel compelled to watch porn. 

Once we become comfortable with this feeling however, you can then apply it to your life without having to think about it.

So you know you should relax if you're feeling like X, Y or Z.  

In other words, we are building health coping mechanisms to replace watching porn.
