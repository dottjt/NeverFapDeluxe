Expression is an important part of the human experience.

It's what allows us to communicate who we are to the world which is a pretty big thing when you think about it.

For without expression we are nothing more than piles of flesh and blood, with no purpose or intention to change the world around us.

Although, I digress.

What's important to understand is that expression is an action.

It's a form doing which is deliberate, and if we think otherwise, we can develop some pretty unrealistic expectations of reality itself.

For example, if you believe expression is passive, you can develop this idea that others should be able to read your mind and understand what you're going through simply by looking at you.

Yet this is not how life works. It works through active communication and so the moral of this story is that unless if you express that something is wrong, others won't be able to help you.

Of course, part of the reason for this is that may be afraid or uncomfortable to express yourself, or you may simply have not expressed yourself frequently in the past.

Well, this exercise aims to address that.

The only way for us to truly understand what expression is, is to actually express ourselves and get ourselves involved with the process of expression.

Furthermore, to discover what expression means to you.

Of course, there's a few principles we want to consider here.

For starters, what we want to practice is an open and honest communication with ourselves.

Because the alternative is dishonest communication, which is just as bad as not communicating at all.

In fact, chances are that you may never done this before, and you might not even know what honest and open communication actually is.

Well, let's find out.

An important thing to note about expression is that it's purely about intention.

When you express yourself, what you're essentially doing is acting with intention.

For example, when you smile you're acting with the intention of being happy. When you cry, you're acting with the intention of being sad.

Now, here's the thing about expression which people seem to overlook or even outright misunderstand.


{{ h3 "Intention doesn't come as a reaction to something which takes place in life." }}


Which is to say that you being sad isn't the reason why you're crying, no different to a happy event not being the reason why you're smiling.

These are merely learnt behaviours which we have develop since childhood.

Rather, your response in regards to these events derives from your intention to feel those things, whether this is happening on a conscious or subconscious level.

In fact, what this truly means is that you have the power to feel whatever intent you desire.

You can be happy right now if you want, just as you can be sad if that is your intention.

In essence, it is your intent of expression of these things which gives you power to feel them.

So for this exercise, what we want to do is practice that intent.

For example, practice being happy for ten minutes.

Ultimately, what's important is paying attention to how you do this, and gauging which actions make you feel which things.

For example, does smiling inherently make you happy? Is expressing the intent of happiness more than just a physical action? Does a mental shift also have to take place?

These are all things which you need to think about and discover for your own, as there are no right or wrong answers to this exercise.

Everyone thinks and feels differently, and it's up to you to discover how you personally operate.

Safe travels, and have fun.
