Expression is an important part of the human experience.

It's essentially what allows us to communicate who we are to the world, which is a pretty big thing in the overall scheme of things.

In other words, expression is what allows us to exist.

Without expression we are nothing more than piles of flesh and blood, with no purpose or place in this earth.

Although, I digress.

What's important to understand about expression is that it's an action. 

It's an action which we deliberate, which allows us to communicate ourselves across with others.


{{< hr3 "And certainly, it's important that we understand that it's an action, otherwise we can develop some pretty unrealistic expectations of what expression is." >}}


For example, a lot of people unknowingly maintain the belief that expression is in fact passive, in the sense that they expect people to be able to read and understand them, without expressing what is actually going on in their mind.

Of course, the only way for us to truly understand what expression is, is to actually express ourselves and get ourselves involved with the process of expression. 

Which is to say that for this exercise, we are going to learn to express ourselves an open and honest manner with ourselves.

Because chances are, we may simply have never done this before. We may actually have no idea what honest and open communication actually is. 

Well, let's find out. 


{{< hr2 "Instructions" >}}


An important thing to note about expression is that it's purely about intention. 

When you express yourself, what you're essentially doing is acting with intention. 

For example, when you smile you're acting with the intention of being happy. When you cry, you're acting with the intention of being sad.

Now, here's the thing about expression which people seem to overlook or even outright misunderstand.


{{ h3 "Intention doesn't come as a reaction to something which takes place in life." }}


Which is to say that you being sad isn't the reason why you're crying, no different to a happy event not being the reason why you're smiling.

These are merely learnt behaviours which we have develop since childhood.

Rather, your response in regards to these events derives from your intention to feel those things, whether this is happening on a conscious or subconscious level.

In fact, what this truly means is that you have the power to feel whatever intent you desire.

You can be happy right now if you want, just as you can be sad if that is your intention.

In essence, it is your intent of expression of these things which gives you power to feel them.

So for this exercise, what we want to do is practice that intent. 

For example, practice being happy for ten minutes. 

Ultimately, what's important is paying attention to how you do this, and gauging which actions make you feel which things. 

For example, does smiling inherently make you happy? Is expressing the intent of happiness more than just a physical action? Does a mental shift also have to take place? 

These are all things which you need to think about and discover for your own, as there are no right or wrong answers to this exercise.

Everyone thinks and feels differently, and it's up to you to discover how you personally operate.

Safe travels, and have fun.
