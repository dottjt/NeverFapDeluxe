This is a fun exercise which most people can benefit from straight-away without too much effort.

Certainly, it was one of the first awareness exercises that I learnt when I was starting out with my own mental health journey.

What this exercise involves is relying on your visual field to change your perception of depth. 

In particular, by manipulating your visual focus in order to change not only what you're seeing, but how you see it as well.  

The reason why it's powerful is because humans are largely visual creatures, and it can really help us detach from our mind and our thoughts once we realise the extent to which we can change what we see consciously.

And that "consciously" aspect really is key here, as we're trying to demonstrate power over our mind through our actions.

That's ultimately what awareness is all about - learning to use our minds effectively so our subconscious fears and behaviours are no longer controlling who we are.

While the instructions are simple, the real benefit comes from how you use your mind during this exercise.

In order to practice this exercise, what you'll want to do is place your hand in front of your face with one finger pointing up.

Essentially, have it far away enough so you can see your finger clearly, but not so close that... I'm sure you get the drift. 

Now, what you'll want to do is focus on that finger. Simply focus your vision on that finger, and notice what you see. 

For example, are you able to focus on anything else while focusing on your finger? What about the background, are you able to focus on that as well?

Then, once you're done exploring that outlet, I want you to (with that finger still up) focus on an object far away from you.

It could be a tree outside. It could be something on the wall. Generally, the further away it is the better this works.

And I want you to focus your visual and most importantly your attention on that object.



Essentially how it works is that you'll place a finger in front of you
