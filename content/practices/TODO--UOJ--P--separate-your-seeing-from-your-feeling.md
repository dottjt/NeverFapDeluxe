<!-- Seeing is not a feeling. -->

<!-- {{< hr2 "Context" >}} -->

This is the kind of exercise that porn addicts benefit from greatly, due to the way it changes your visual perception of reality.

So let's get crackin'.

The intention behind a lot of these exercises is to assist you in breaking down what you understand.

The word "understand" of course meaning the conglomerate of knowledge you've gain through learning and life experience.

Part of the reason why we want to break down your understanding of life and reality, is because it's largely counter intuitive from the perspective of giving up porn. 


{{< hr4 "You see, what you "understand" is that you absolutely must watch porn." >}}


What you "understand" is that you don't have the self-control not to watch porn, and that it's a lot easier if you just relapse and watch porn rather than commit to NeverFap. 

Which is perfectly fine.

I mean, it's simply what you understand. You can't help what you've been taught up until now. It simply is.

On the other hand, it's also perfectly fine to change your understanding so that it can help you overcome porn addiction, which is exactly what this website aims to do.

For today's exercise, we want to break down our visual understanding of reality, because it largely ties in to how we interact with reality in general.

Specifically, what we want to do is separate our thoughts and feelings, from what we're actually seeing in front of us.

As humans, we tend to attach meaning and value to things we can physically see.

It could be a trinket that belongs to your family. It could be the sight of McDonalds in the distance and the memories that place evokes. It could even be something more conceptual, like a particular scene within a movie. 


{{< hr4 "With this exercise we want to attempt to separate these two elements of what we see, along with how we feel about that which we see." >}}


Because what we see is not what we feel. They are two completely separate elements which we've learnt to associate.

Think of them as two completely different sensations. The sensation of seeing, and the sensation of feeling. 

Why is this important?

Well, take the humble porn addict for example.

For a porn addict, porn is not just "two people having sex". It is a complex relationship which evokes a whole range of feelings and emotions.

Yet when you think about it, porn really is just "two people having sex". 

Sure, it's something that a lot of humans find destructively addictive, but it's hard to deny that from a seeing perspective, there's nothing that awful about it. 

With this in mind, what this exercise attempts to do is help you come to the understand that porn is simply "two people having sex".

And the way we do this is by separating what we feel and what we see into two different categories. 

Because currently we may have a habit of jumbling them together, and not quite realising all the steps our mind takes when jumping to the understanding of "I really, really must watch porn".

One thing to notice is that this exercise may seem incredibly similar to <a class="link" href="/practices/dissolve-your-visual-perception-of-reality/">Dissolve Your Visual Perception Of Reality</a>.

Both exercises focus on manipulating our visual understanding in some way, however both exercises do completely different things.

Dissolve Your Visual Perception Of Reality attempts to completely absolve our understanding of reality, while this exercise attempts to rearrange our understanding of it.


{{< hr2 "Instructions" >}}


For this exercise, what we want to do is look at some things, and try and figure out the difference between what we're seeing and what we're feeling. 

We can do this sitting down at home, or anywhere really.

Observe what you see. Observe what you feel.

Can you distinguish any difference between those two things? What are those differences? Is there even a difference?

Play around with it. Try this exercises in different areas and different places. See if you can discover any common themes.
