I love this exercise.

I can't quite tell if this exercise is an analogue to <a class="link" href="/articles/slow-it-down">Slow it down</a> or a percursor to it, however they're both different approaches to the same thing. 

Usually you end up using both in conjunction, but it's arguably easier to learn them as separate, unique skills.

All awareness exercises essentially come down to finding different ways to break our perception of who we are.

This is a very important task because our perception of who we are, isn't actually who we are.

It is merely an identity we carry to help us navigate through life. 

And when we don't realise this, or aren't consciously aware of this label that we prescribe to ourselves on a daily basis, then we can become ransom to this persona.

By learning to control this identity, we provide ourselves with the opportunity to be able to directly control how we feel, without relying on the expectations of this persona.


{{< hr4 "What this exercise attempts to do is help you better disassociate yourself from this persona." >}}


The end goal isn't necessarily to completely dissolve this persona (not that there's anything wrong with pursuing that; it's simply impractical for most people, including myself).

However to be able to dissolve it at will, as well keep on top of when it may be beginning to get out of hand so we can dissolve it on the spot.

Essentially, what this exercise teaches you is to learn to let go from a very physical perspective in the sense of stopping your thinking altogether.

A very important skill in any case.

This exercise generally only works while you're doing something.

It could be some sort of activity. You could be walking down the street in an attempt to get somewhere. 

Some sort of action where you're intent of achieving or getting something done. 


{{< hr4 "During that activity, what you want to do is turn off your mind completely." >}}


Like, just shut it off. 

It can help to pretend as if you're a robot that's just had it's power supply cut off.

One thing to keep in mind is that it's an exercice that's largely conceptual and based on feeling.

Obviously it's impossible to actually 'shut off' completely, however the idea is to really embrace the feeling of it you really could. 

Really explore the idea. 

What does shutting off entail? Are there any steps towards shutting down, or is it literally instant? 

What does it feel like to be shut down? Are there any feelings at all? 

Play with it and see where it takes you.
