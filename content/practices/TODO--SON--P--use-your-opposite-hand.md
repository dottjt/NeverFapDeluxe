This exercise is incredibly profound.

Essentially the idea behind this exercise is to force limitation, and learn not to respond as a result.

As I've written about extensively, part of what makes NeverFap effective is learning not to respond in the face of adversity. 

It's a large part of what it means to remain calm and relaxed.

Truth is that there are simply situations in life which are out of our control. It could be the death of a family member. It could be the loss of your job. 



{{< hr2 "Instructions" >}}

For this exercise we want to begin using our less-dominant hand in order to complete everyday tasks.

It could be brushing your teeth. It could be washing the dishes. It could be writing. It could be using your phone.

It could be any number of things and I want you to take note of not only the feeling, however also your thoughts in relation to this activity.

Do you feel less capable as a person?
