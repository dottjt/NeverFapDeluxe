<!-- {{< hr2 "Context" >}} -->

This is an amazing exercise, especially in regards to developing control over our focus and attention.

In particular, this will help you learn to ignore women in public, and learn to focus on what is truly important instead: Yourself.

Humans usually function better when they have a clear goal in mind, and this exercise has been designed to teach you how to develop these goals in a very simple way.

Certainly, this exercise works best if you're in public where there are plenty of people, otherwise it can still work even if you're stationary.


{{< hr2 "Instructions" >}}


The exercise is quite simple (well, most of these exercises are simple, although difficult to execute consistently).

What you'll want to do is stare straight ahead while you're moving (obviously within reason, it'd be a shame if you got hit by a car etc.)

Often what happens, especially if you're a porn addict, is that you will go looking and search when you're in public. 

Obviously, at other women or men.

With this exercise, we're going to train ourselves not to do this, by having a higher principle in mind.

Rather than search around, we are instead going to stare straight ahead in front of us.
