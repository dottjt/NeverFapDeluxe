<!-- VERY HAPPY WITH THIS -->

This exercise encompasses one of the most fundamental skills in meditation: 

<hr />

#### To become aware of our senses.

<hr />

It is a skill which will form the foundation of almost all awareness-related exercises.

<hr />

## Context

<hr />

This is the kind of exercise that people struggle with for years, only because they attempt it without proper context as to how it should be done. 

In part, because they simply try too hard to try and observe, thinking it's kind of zen-like method that requires all their effort and attention.

Well, let's try a different approach.

One thing to understand is that you're already observing reality. 

You're breathing. You're blinking. You're seeing. 

You simply haven't applied that extra step of making yourself aware of all those things which you are currently doing. 

<hr />

### Observation is nothing more than paying attention to your senses.

<hr />

It's literally that simple. 

You don't need to attempt to try and find something that's not there, nor even manipulate your interpretation of what you're feeling or thinking.

That may be the end goal of meditation, however it's certainly not the raw practice of it. 

Instead, just relax. 

Notice your thoughts and feelings. 

Notice if you have a particular reaction to those thoughts and feelings.

Literally, it's about sitting there (or standing, or walking, or whatever you happen to be doing) and paying attention to what you're feeling and thinking. 

<hr/>

#### Where I personally feel a lot of people explaining this go wrong, is that they focus on this whole "really try to empty your thoughts" or "attempt to refrain from judgement" angle. 

<hr/>

Because it essentially implies that you have to do "more" to somehow achieve these states of mind.

Yet that's simply not true.

You don't have to change anything. 

You simply need to observe what you're currently thinking and feeling. 

Awareness works by simply being aware, which as a consequence (and I would argue, by design) helps you effortlessly empty your mind, as well as help you unconditionally refrain from judgement.

So don't worry about trying to prevent your thoughts, or getting frustrating if you can't stop thinking.

You're not doing anything wrong. 

<hr />

#### Another important thing to keep in mind is that there is no 'ideal' state of mind that we are attempting to achieve.

<hr />

Instead, what we're doing is exploring. 

We're exploring how we feel, how we think, as well as discovering what we personally find enjoyable and empowering. 

Ultimately, you can choose to be frustrated, sad or even outright anxious.

Only you can decide how you want to feel in life, and the responsibility is entirely in your hands.

<hr />

## Exercise

<hr />

This exercise is simple.

Simply, observe. 

Observe what you're feeling. Observe what you're thinking. 

<hr />

#### Observe all the various interactions that are taking place in your mind. 

<hr />

Remember, you're not attempting to change anything. Instead you're merely keeping note and acknowledging what your mind is doing. 

It's important to keep in mind is that observation is a very specific skill that we may not be well versed in.

Which is to say that we may by default be in a constant state of reaction and judgement, rather than in a state of observation.

So don't be alarmed if you find simply observing your senses to be difficult.

There's always a first for everything.
