<!-- VERY HAPPY WITH THIS -->

This exercise is designed to help dissolve your ego.

The way this is achieved is through active reinterpretation of your visual understanding of reality. 

In fact, all awareness exercises are designed to help dissolve your ego to some extent, however this one does it particularly well.

Excellent.


{{< hr2 "Context" >}}


Much like the <a class="link" href="/articles/slow-it-down">Slow it down</a> exercise, Dissolve it down is about changing our interpretation of reality.

In order to understand why, we need to focus on how humans interpret reality to begin with. 

The way humans largely relate to the world is through language. We use words and symbols in order to define and describe reality, which forms an essential part of the human experience.

It's what helps us gauge social and survival situations, learn new theoretical concepts and better understand the world around us.

And yet although we live in this predefined world of assumptions based on what we understand, none of it is actually 'real'.

Just like how some cultures prefering bowing to shaking hands as a preferred method of greeting, it says nothing about what humans are. 

Extending this further, some cultures view certain people as being more important and more significant than others. 

Yet inspite of this perception, we are all merely people.

Essentially, what we intend to do with this exercise is help us distinguish between the rules and descriptions of reality, with actual reality itself. 

While these rules serve a purpose, they can also serve to distort how we understand reality. 

Take what you see in your visual field for example.

Instinctively we create visual depth. We identify objects. We identify how far away they are. We identify those objects which are living. We identify dangers, and so forth.

Can we even call it reality?

Is it possible to truly 'see' when our minds are in a constant state of evaluation?

What this exercise attempts to do is exercise our ability to remove this bias from our visual understanding of reality. 

Not only to see a 'clearer' picture of reality, but to better understand what we're actually experiencing on a day to day basis.

For this exercise, what we want to do is attempt to treat our visual field as a simple plane of a light and colour. 

No objects. No descriptions. No focusing on certain details over another. No intepretation.

Nuthin'.

Instead, what we want to do is treat our visual field as a non-descript arrangement of light and colour.

It usually helps to imagine everything as a cloud of sensation, and that is all there is.

Certainly, don't try to focus. Keep your attention wide and merely feel as if you're intaking the visual information around you, rather than you trying to actively 'change' how you perceive. 

Relax.

While you can do this anywhere, I personally find it works best when I have a good few minutes alone, where I can really explore this idea uninterupted.

If you want to take it a step further, ask yourself this question: Who or what is intepreting this vision? Does it exist within this cloud of sensation? 

A more advanced concept we will explore in future once we've mastered these more simpler exercises.
