<!-- VERY HAPPY WITH THIS -->


This exercise is designed to help dissolve your ego.

In particular, by getting you to engage in the active reinterpretation of your visual field.

Before then however, we must first come to understand how humans interpret reality. Otherwise we may miss the true importance of this exercise.


{{< hr3 "On a conceptual level, the way humans largely relate to the world is through the use of language." >}}


We use words and symbols in order to define and describe reality, which is how we communicate with the world around us.

It's what allows us to gauge social and survival situations, learn new theoretical concepts and better understand the relationship between you and your surrounds.

And yet although we live in this predefined world of assumptions based on what we understand on a very conceptual level.

None of it is actually 'real'.


{{< hr3 "Numbers, for example, are not real. They're just mathematical descriptions." >}}


From a culture perspective, the all the predefined rules we have in regards to how we should act and behave are also not 'real'.

Take greetings for example.

Some cultures prefer kissing as opposed to shaking hands, and yet none of these things actually describe what humans are.

Although society attempts to define us based on our behaviours and how we act, it still doesn't change the fact that we all have five fingers, require nutrition and have a need to be loved.


{{< hr3 "We are all still merely people." >}}


Our addiction to porn maintains similar standards.

We can find ourselves drawn to certain types of porn or certain types of fetishes - even though it's all just humans interacting with other humans at the end of the day.

...or even on a more fundamental level, just a bunch of light eminating from a computer screen.

Essentially, what we intend to do with this exercise is to help you distinguish between these rules and descriptions, between the actual physicality of perception itself.

Which is to say, what you actually see (i.e. light and colour) vs your actual interpretation of it (i.e. a person standing in front of you) 

While these rules serve a purpose, they can also serve to distort how we understand reality. 

Take what you see in your visual field for example.

Instinctively we create visual depth. We identify objects. We identify how far away they are. We identify those objects which are living. We identify dangers, and so forth.


{{< hr3 "Yet what information do we lose with all this additional mental processing?" >}}


Can we even call it reality?

Is it possible to truly 'see' when our minds are in a constant state of evaluation?

What this exercise attempts to do is exercise our ability to remove this bias from our visual understanding of reality. 

Not only to see a 'clearer' picture of reality, but to better understand what we're actually experiencing on a day to day basis.


{{< hr2 "Instructions" >}}


For this exercise, what we want to do is attempt to treat our visual field as a simple plane of a light and colour. 

No objects. No descriptions. No focusing on certain details over another. No intepretation.

Nuthin'.

Instead, what we want to do is treat our visual field as a non-descript arrangement of light and colour.

It usually helps to imagine everything as a cloud of sensation, and that is all there is.

Certainly, don't try to focus. Keep your attention wide and merely feel as if you're intaking the visual information around you, rather than you trying to actively 'change' how you perceive. 

Relax.

While you can do this anywhere, I personally find it works best when I have a good few minutes alone, where I can really explore this idea uninterupted.

If you want to take it a step further, ask yourself this question: Who or what is intepreting this vision? Does it exist within this cloud of sensation? 

A more advanced concept we will explore in future once we've mastered these more simpler exercises.
