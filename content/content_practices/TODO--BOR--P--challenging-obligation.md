This exercise is incredibly powerful.

It's a very direct and physical way of changing how our minds works and as you'll find, this exercise takes a lot of inspiration from other exercises such as **Stop Absolutely Everything You're Doing** in a more reactive way.

Ultimately, the premise behind this exercise relates to this idea of change, so let's talk about that for a moment.

The interesting thing about change is that people often assume that it's some kind of switch that flicks on in the back of your mind, which sudden propels you into a state of doing and becoming.

Certainly, this kind of attitude culminates from a typical victim mindset, whereby we believe we are not responsible for the outcomes in our life, and instead are victim to our circumstances.

Instead, what we are going to do with this exercise is express change as a fully active and conscious idea which you are 100% fully in control of.

After all, the premise of NeverFap Deluxe is to develop our capacity for conscious awareness, so that we can develop our ability to act inspite of the existing dysfunction which we are trying to address.

And the very thing which we are attempting to address in this exercise is the current obligation you feel not to succeed.

That's correct, your obligation not to succeed. 

When you decide not to meditate, not to follow through on your dreams and not to use your time in a meaningful and productive way, you are giving into your obligation not to succeed. 

Because often the reason why we don't do those things is because we don't feel like doing them. Which is to say that we may feel obliged not to succeed.

Of course, we never frame it like that. Instead, we say that we're too tired to try or that we never had a chance to begin with. 

Which when you put it like that, doesn't seem so harmful. Yet in the bigger picture of your own goals, is nothing more than delaying your success in life. 

So in essence, this exercise is designed to help you change how your mind works and responds in regards to that sense of obligation you feel when you don't feel like being your best self. 

Which is why a lot of people find it very challenging to do, despite of how simple it actually is.


{{< hr2 "Instructions" >}}

The idea behind this exercise is to challenge our beliefs and pre-conceived notions of what we believe is necessary.

In the previous exercise, what we wanted to do is first identify our obligations.

In this exercise, what we want to do is directly disobey them.

For example, you may feel obliged to read your email at a certain hour, or to check our phone for messages.

What we want to do is not do that.
