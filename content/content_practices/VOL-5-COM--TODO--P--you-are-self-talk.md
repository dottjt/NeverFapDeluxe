Self-talk refers to the self-created thoughts and judgements we have in our mind.

Usually this self-talk is something which takes place on a subconscious level, like when we automatically self-criticise or express frustration when we do something wrong.

In other cases, people will attempt to rely on self-talk as a form of motivation, you know, as a way to pump ourselves up when we're feeling down or to reassure ourselves that everything will be okay when something has gone wrong.

And there are all sorts of reasons why we've taught ourselves to do this, most commonly as a coping mechanism to address our difficult feelings. 

Well, I'm here to tell you that it's unhealthy. 

Essentially it's a form of rumination, which gets in the way of helping us be truly calm and present with ourselves.

At best it's a form of distraction which does absolutely nothing to help us develop control over our minds. 

When you self-talk you engage in a false form of empowerment, in part because it is an attempt at manipulating your own emotions in order to change them (which doesn't fundamentally work).

But also because when you engage in self-talk long enough, it can eventually form into habit which is when it begins to truly ruin your life as you find yourself ruminating out of your own control.

Which is essentially how you end up developing mental illness.

So rather than head down that dark and somewhat gloomy path, let's instead focus our attention towards eliminating the self-talk in our minds, so we can instead thrive without all the pointless mental chatter. 

Just remember, a calm mind is an effective mind and it's impossible to remain calm when your mind is constantly thinking and engaging in self-created narratives. 

It's time to cut the fat.

Your task with this exercise is to both identify and refrain from self-talk.

Ultimately, while self-talk can most commonly be identified via verbal cues, it can actually help to think of them instead as a form of emotional reaction. 

After all, we most commonly engage in self-talk in response to something that's taken place (although certainly we can self-talk out of habit as well).

So paying attention to when you feel emotion can be a great way to learn more about how your mind operates.

Only through awareness can we hope to change our behaviours, otherwise we ultimately leave our recovery to chance and in most cases, this means continuing to refinforce these negative habits.

And by practicing this exercise, we can learn to develop our capacity for conscious awareness in a meaningful way.

Personally speaking I tend to self-talk in situations where my mind is no longer preoccupied, like when I'm walking to the train station and my mind has nothing to do.
