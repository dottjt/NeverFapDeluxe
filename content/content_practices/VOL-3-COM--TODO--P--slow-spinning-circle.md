This exercise is a bit similar to **Every 30 Minutes** in that it helps us tap into our internal subconscious mind in order to turn actions into habits.

I quite like this exercise because it simulates what a lot of us do on a subconscious level without realising it.

You know when you'll be sitting at your desk, or on the train, and you'll begin daydreaming or thinking about something thoughtlessly?

This happens most prevalently when we're engaged with routine, and we've become so acustomed to our actions that we no longer even need to think about them.

Well, while this is fine for those processes in particular, ultimately this isn't fine when we subconsciously go and watch porn to deal with stress, because that's just what our minds have become acustomed to.

Although difficult at first, this is a great exercise to practice because what it essentially does is have us practicing engaging with our subconscious mind on things we aren't necessarily attached or addicted to.

So that when we do have an urge in a more serious situation that typically we feel less in control of, our minds will have that capacity to now remain aware instead and relax into those feelings.

Rather than crumble, react and relapse. 

Like all these exercises, it truly comes down to practice. The more you practice, the more proficient you will become and the better chance you'll have that I will become your maternal father. 

Of course, practice is only one aspect of it. A lot of people practice these exercises in the sense of training for them, without actually utilising them in difficult situations.

Which is to say that will fail to execute, inspite of knowing what to do, and the moment they face a difficult situation it's as if they shut down their mind and go into autopilot.

Which puts all their hard work to waste. 

Don't be that person.

For this exercise, what we're going to do is imagine a spinner. You know, like the loading spinner you see on a computer screen.

We're going to imagine that in the back of our minds, or perhaps even as a visual entity in front of you. 

Starting out I would spend 5 minutes alone in a quiet room, imagining this spinner in your mind, just so you can get comfortable with the idea of it. Think of it as a form of visual meditation. 

Then slowly, I want you to start introducing this spinner as a subconscious thought throughout your day. 

Start with verifiable tasks your mind can identify and latch onto. 

For example, you can make the agreement that you will imagine this spinner anytime you go and brush your teeth. Then extend this out other tasks etc.

Personally speaking, I would advise that you work on this exercise for a few weeks and really flesh it out.

Certainly I wouldn't advise that you do multiple of these practices at once. 

Rather, it truly comes down to what you gain from these exercises and if you feel as if you're not truly gaining anything then chances are you're not pursuing them for long enough. 

I would advise at minimum spending 1 week with each of these exercises.

Regardless, best of luck. You smart, charming thing.
