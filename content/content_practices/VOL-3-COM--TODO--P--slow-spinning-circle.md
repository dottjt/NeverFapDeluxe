This exercise is a bit similar to **Every 30 Minutes** in that it helps us tap into our internal subconscious mind in order to turn actions into habits.

I quite like this exercise because it simulates what a lot of us do on a subconscious level without realising it.

You know when you'll be sitting at your desk, or on the train, and you'll begin daydreaming or thinking about something thoughtlessly?

Often as a result of consistent routine, these thoughtless behaviours are usually as a result of becoming so acustomed to our actions that we no longer even need to think about them in order to carry them out.

Well, while this is fine for processes such as getting dressed in the morning, ultimately this isn't fine when we subconsciously go and watch porn to deal with stress, because that's just what our minds have become acustomed to.

For example, a lot of us will have very specific times throughout the day where we'll feel the urge to masturbate, such as when when get home from school or work, and it's a destructive cycle which a lot of us can't seem to break. 

Although difficult at first, this is a great exercise to practice because what it essentially does is teach us to engage with our subconscious mind on conscious level.

And the way we are going to do this, is by focusing our attention on things we aren't necessarily attached or addicted to.

Which will help train us for when we do face a more serious situation that typically we will feel less in control of, so our minds can have that capacity of awareness to instead relax and remain calm.

Rather than crumble, react and relapse. 

The classic trifecta. 

Like all these exercises here on NeverFap Deluxe, it truly comes down to practice. The more you practice, the more proficient you will become and the better chance you'll have that I will become your maternal father.

Of course, practice is only one aspect of it. Actually engaging with your mind on a conscious level when you do struggle is another thing. 

Which is to say that inspite of knowing what to do, and inspite of practicing these skills on a daily basis, a lot of people will end up shutting their minds and instead go into autopilot when facing a difficult situation.

Well, this is exactly what we are trying to address with this exercise.

For this exercise, what we're going to do is imagine a spinner. You know, like the loading spinner you see on a computer screen.

And we're going to attempt to imagine this spinner either at a conceptual level in the back of our minds, or perhaps even as a visual entity in front of you. 

Kind of like a floating object in front of you, for those of you who have used a VR headset before. 

Starting out I would spend a few minutes alone in a quiet room, imagining this spinner in your mind, just so you can get comfortable with the idea of it. Think of it as a form of visual meditation. 

Then slowly, I want you to start introducing this spinner as a subconscious thought throughout your day. 

It can help to begin with verifiable tasks your mind can identify on a conscious level, such as making the agreement that you will imagine this spinner anytime you go and brush your teeth. 

Then to extend this out other tasks as you become more aware of what you are trying to achieve with this exercise. 

Perhaps you may want to visual this spinner when you're on the train on the way to work, or perhaps when you're in the kitchen pouring yourself a nice glass of water.

I would personally spend a few weeks working on this exercise so you can really flesh it out, although that's really up to you. 

Regardless, best of luck. You smart, charming thing.

Play around and see where this takes you.
