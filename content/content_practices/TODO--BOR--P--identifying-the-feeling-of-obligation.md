Human responsibility is a funny thing.

When we are deemed responsible for something, it can provide us with an incredible amount of incentive and motivation to act in concert with these responsibilities.

For example, if we have a child we have to look after, it can feel as if we've been provided with an insurmountable task whereby we must do absolutely everything within our power to ensure the child remains safe. 

What's funny is that much like everything else in life, responsibilty is merely a feeling.

Which is to say that it is not concrete, merely an expectation you've set yourself.

In essence, the reason why you end up looking after that child is because you feel obliged to do it, not because you necesarily have to in any capacity.

Sure, there are consequences. But there's literally nothing stopping you from walking out the door and never returning. 

And this is important for us to realise, because often we can subconsciously put ourselves into positions where we feel obliged to act, when that may not necessarily make any sense for anyone.
