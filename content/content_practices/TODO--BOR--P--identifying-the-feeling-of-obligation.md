This exercise is incredibly powerful.

It's a very direct and physical way of changing how our minds work and as you'll discover, this exercise takes a lot of inspiration from other exercises such as **Stop Absolutely Everything You're Doing** in a more conditional way.

Ultimately, the premise behind this exercise relates to this idea of change, so let's talk about that for a moment.

An interesting thing to note about change is that it's often assumed to act like some kind of switch that flicks on in the back of your mind, which sudden propels you into a state of doing and becoming.

Certainly, this kind of attitude culminates from typical victim mindsets, whereby we believe we are not responsible for the outcomes in our life, and are instead are subject to our circumstances.

Instead, what we are going to do with this exercise is express change as a fully active and conscious idea in which we are 100% in control of ourselves.

After all, the premise of NeverFap Deluxe is to develop our capacity for conscious awareness, so that we can develop the ability to act inspite of the existing dysfunction which we are trying to address.

And the very thing which we are attempting to address in this exercise is the current obligation we may feel not to succeed.

That's correct, your obligation not to succeed.

Whenever you decide not to meditate, follow through with your dreams or use your time in a meaningful and productive way, you are giving into your obligation not to succeed.

Because often the reason why we don't want to do those things is because we don't feel like doing them.

Which is to say that our focus is fixated on that feeling, it means our attention isn't being direct towards executing actual empowering actions which lead to solid outcomes.

Of course, we never frame it like that.

Instead, we say that we're too tired to try or that we never had a chance to begin with, because it's not something we're consciously aware of.

Perhaps because you're afraid of knowing the truth, or in a lot of cases because you've simply been aware all along that this is how your mind has operated.

Because when you frame it in terms of excuses and reasons, our actions no longer seem so harmful and meaningless. Instead, we feel justified in our decisions, which is how we cope with our directionless.

Yet in the bigger picture of your own goals, is nothing more than delaying your success in life.

So in essence, this exercise is designed to help you change how your mind works and responds in regards to that sense of obligation you feel when you don't feel like being your best self.

Which is why a lot of people find it very challenging to do, despite of how simple it actually is.


{{< hr2 "Instructions" >}}


The idea behind this exercise is to identify those feelings and obligations which prevent us from being successful.

Not to judge, but simply to observe and notice how you react in regards to these feelings.

Often, simply noticing these feelings is more-than enough for us to learn not to react to them.

Once you do identify those feelings, all you have to do is simply relax.

Relax into the feeling. Take note of it. Then simply move on.

There's nothing to question. Nothing to think about.

Because ultimately, this is how we should be living our lives. Without fear, reaction or anxiety.

Simply continuing to maintain balance so we can be as effective as possible.
