This is the first exercise that I ever started with when I began my mental health journey back in the relative stone age.

What I love about this exercise is that it always ends up flooring people in terms of the impact it can have in terms of helping them better understand the power of their own conscious awareness.

Not to mention, it's just a great mindset to think about and apply in general.

Although, before I get into the nitty-gritty of how this exercise works, I would like put in a disclaimer: 


{{< hr3 "This exercise is highly abusable." >}}


In fact, I'm yet to see anyone not actually abuse this exercise, but at the same time I also recognise that this abuse is likely inevitably for most.

What I essentially mean to say that most people end up using this exercise in an unhealthy way, where they end up feeling and embracing gratitude to a point of delusion.

To a point where it's no longer gratitude, and simply feelings of mania under the guise of gratitude.

Which is totally understandable, because discovering happiness for a depressed person is like giving crack to a child, and discovering it can produce all sorts of madness. 

The other issue is that gratitute itself goes against a lot of the principles of neutrality that we are trying to adopt, so really this exercise should be thought of as a perspective exercise for you to learn from.

Rather than a hard mindset you should adopt. 

Regardless, for beginners it can be a great way to have that "spark" of awareness where they realise there is actually hope and they actually have control over their mind. 

So let's get to it!

For starters, I would describe gratitude as a feeling, which can then progress into a state-of-mind once you begin to embrace this feeling long enough. 

And what we intend to do with this exercise, is express gratitude in everything we do. 

Of course, what exactly is gratitude? How do you feel it?

In order to answer that question it really comes down to expression and how we can express ourselves effectively. 

In this particular case, what we are expressing is gratitude - which is the feeling of being grateful.

This means being thankful for your own existence. This means not taking the things you have in life for granted. This means appreciating what you have in life, not as something that is deserving of you, but something which you have been blessed with.

Often, we take what we have in life for granted, and ties in with developing unhealthy and unrealistic expectations of life. 

Instead, with this exercise we want to reverse this pattern and instead be grateful for what we have.

Of course, that's precisely why we're practicing this exercise so you can learn these things for yourself.

Afterall, you may genuinely not know what it means to be grateful, in part because you may have never felt it in any meaningful way.

Certainly, I know I felt the same way about love, even within my own family, and it wasn't until I experienced my first relationship did I finally feel it in any meaningful way.

Although I digress.
