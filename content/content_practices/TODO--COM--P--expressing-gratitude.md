This exercise is surprisingly effective.

This is the first exercise that I ever started with, and it's an exercise which always ends up flooring me in terms of the impact that it can have in the day-to-day of our conscious awareness.

Not to mention, it helps teach us a few important key things about how our mind works.

For starters, it can help to understand what gratitude is. 

I would personally say that it's equal parts feeling as it is a state-of-mind.

Certainly, while you only notice the feeling of gratitude, I find that it's a lot easier to remain grateful throughout the day with a particular state of mind.

Of course, that's precisely why we're practicing this exercise so you can learn these things for yourself.

Afterall, you may genuinely not know what it means to be grateful, in part because you may have never felt it in any meaningful way.

Certainly, I know I felt the same way about love, even within my own family, and it wasn't until I experienced my first relationship did I finally feel it in any meaningful way.

Although I digress.
