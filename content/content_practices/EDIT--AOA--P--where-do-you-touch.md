<b>Where Do You Touch?</b> is another classic awareness exercise which is designed to help you develop focus and attention.

By "classic" I mean it's another variation of the tried-and-true "pay attention to X thing throughout the day" that I'm sure you've seen in abundance on this website.

Well, the reason why I write so many of them is because they're incredibly effective at getting you to think about awareness in a unique way.

Which is to say that you should be practicing awareness in everything you do, and that this exercise is merely a shortcut to having you eventually do this automatically.

Awareness is important because it's what allows you to understand and learn your own behaviours, not only to change them, but also to enhance them.

By practicing awareness in any capacity, we train our ability to catch ourselves doing silly things, like watching porn when we're feeling stressed.

And instead, consciously decide within that moment, to replace that unhealthy coping mechanism with a healthy coping mechanism instead.

The more we practice this, the more it will help us to think in terms of using our awareness in an empowering way, and eventually it will become second-nature to us. 

Overtime we will become more aware of all our behaviours and quirks, and this is when we will develop full-control over our lives.

In this exercise we're going to be paying attention to our body and how it interacts with touch.

Essentially, I want you to take note of whenever you're touching something. 

For example, I'm currently using my fingers to tap against this keyboard in order to type these words.

And yet although it's something I spend most my day doing, it's not something I've ever really thought about.

Well, that's precisely the problem we're trying to address. To begin thinking about behaviours which your brain has subconsciously ignored for decades.

For example, your response to masturbate daily as a way to deal with certain feelings and emotions.

In addition, an important aspect of this exercise is to pay attention to the feeling of touch as well.

What does it feel like when you bump into something? Does it hurt when you touch something? Does it feel hot or cold? Does it evoke emotion? 

Only by becoming aware of our senses can we not only learn to better understand how they relate to our conscious experience.

However it can help us to better control the experience itself once we become aware of our behaviours related to touch.
