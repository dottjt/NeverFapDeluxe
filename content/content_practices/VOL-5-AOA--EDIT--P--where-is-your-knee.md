This is another one of those classic awareness exercises where we pay attention to some aspect of our reality.

They're classic because you've probably seen them a thousand times before on this website, but the reason I create them is because they're effective.

In this exercise what you're going to be doing is paying attention to the location of your knee.

The idea is nothing remarkable, yet it's an effective way for us to develop control over our mind and expand our capacity for awareness.

I suppose what makes this awareness exercise different to something like **Take Note Of The Colour Yellow** is that the focus of this exercise is on some aspect that is attached to yourself, rather than something which is external to you.

And although it may seem like a small thing, it actually changes quite a lot in terms of your focus.

No longer does it mean seeking that which we see in reality and instead, is more about being aware of some aspect of our physicality. 

Regardless, it's a great way to engage the mind on a conscious level, which is actually incredibly difficult to do.

Throughout the day, I want you to take notice of your knee.

It can be as simple as a brief acknowledgement, or perhaps you may even want to look at your knee for a moment.

I know this exercise can be a bit of a surreal experience for a lot of people, as your knee is something you've probably never thought about before.

What purpose does it serve? Are you grateful that you have a knee? Is it something which deserves the expression of gratitude?

All questions which can help you better understand yourself.

Furthermore, what's important is to observe how you react to the exercise itself. 

Do you get frustrated if you find out that you've forgetten to observe your knee? Do you take it personally?
