For a lot of people, struggle forms a large part of the porn addiction recovery experience and one of the primary reasons for this is because people simply don't know better. 

When struggle is literally all you know, because you've experienced nothing but struggle, then inherently it's going to become a frame of mind which you will continually expect.

Every step of the way.

I suppose a key thing to understand about struggle is that no one wants to struggle. 

Which is to say that struggle is simply what takes place when people become desperate and clueness, in a final attempt to cope without actually knowing how to cope effectively at all.

It's equivalent to screaming at a wall in order to knock it down. 

It helps us create the feeling and emotion of progress, without actually helping us truly change, remain calm or develop control over our minds.

Which is to say that it's a form of distraction at best.

So rather than struggle, what we aim to do instead is learn how to cope effectively with our emotions, so we can instead thrive and grow as human beings. 

Rather than continue to get nowhere, and one of the biggest ways we struggle is when we fight ourselves. 

How do we fight ourselves? 

Well, largely through judgement and reaction.

To understand this, often our first response when we struggle or face difficultly is to react. We think "Okay, things aren't working out and I'm not feeling too great, and I need to do something about it."

The problem is that we don't know what to do, and so in trying to react it simply makes us feel anxious, frustrated or depressed, as we try to scramble for a solution we do not have. 

In other cases what happens is that we can begin to self-criticise in our hopelessness, usually as a form of motivation or even reasoning.


"Why can't I do this? Why is this so hard? Why am I so stupid for not being able to figure this out?" 


Now the reason why I describe it as a fight is because much like screaming at a brick wall, reacting or being self-critical will always be a one-sided battle against yourself. 

Which is to say that it will be a constant struggle until you learn to let go and simply refrain from these behaviours.

Because that truly is the alternative to fighting yourself: To simply be present with yourself and not to engage with these behaviours.

In other words, to simply remain calm and present with yourself, rather than pursue the judgement and reaction inherent in struggle.

There's a quote that goes something along the lines of "You are your own worst enemy" and this rings particularly true when it comes to porn addiction recovery.

When you fight yourself, whether it be resistance to meditation or doubting the recovery process, you engage yourself in struggle and don't recover.

For this exercise what we want to do is identify the ways with which we fight ourselves. 

Perhaps you're particularly self-critical. Perhaps you react to your emotions and feelings, rather than simply let them go. Maybe you frequently doubt yourself.

The idea behind this exercise is to help you build your awareness of how and where you lose balance in your life. 

In essence, so you can learn to let go of these behaviours and truly be free with yourself, which means no longer dealing with urges or 
 
In order to help you identify how you fight yourself, it can help to understand that fighting is a conscious decision. You actively pursuing those behaviours which cause you self-harm and which affect your emotions.
