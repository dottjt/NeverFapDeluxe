<!-- {{< hr2 "Context" >}} -->

I absolutely LOVE this exercise.

I would say it's probably one of the best exercises I've come up with, especially in terms of demonstrating what exactly it is we're trying to achieve with NeverFap Deluxe from a process perspective.



Essentially what we want to do for this exercise is to carry out a bunch of tasks without thinking.

At all.

What we are training ourselves to do is to embrace the power of process, without mentally meddling with the process in any way.
