In this exercise we're going to be taking the initial steps towards developing a solid routine.

Part of the reason why people struggle with routine is because they severely overcomplicate it. 

They assume it's about developing an intricate, fool-proof strategy when really it's much more fundamental than even having a strategy overall. 

Instead, 90% of the battle when it comes to developing a solid routine, comes down to our ability to stick to it.

In other words, our ability to prioritise those things which are actually important.

Ultimately that's all routine is.

So why do people struggle with developing or even sticking to routine? 




Simply, for routine's sake. 

Often a lot of people have a difficult time figuring out exactly what they want to do in life, so they. 

We are going to develop a hard routine.



This exercise signifies the importance of trying new things.

It's why I recommend it's super helpful to learn new things. It doesn't matter what you're learning. its

A key component to this exercise is truly understanding the nature of actions and consequences. Precisely that all your actions have consequences and that focusing on these actions is a great way to train our mind to.

Last week we talked about fear, doubt and fear, doubt, and fear, doubt and the occassional mention of doubt, oh and did I mention fear!? Woah dude, no you didn't. You psycho. Well, In this episode we're going to talk about expectations.
  In particular, how you can set healthy expectations throughout your journey.
  What are some of the ways we promote unhealthy expectations?
  Why do I have a camel toe!
  So in today's show we're really going to focus on this idea of process and how we can think in terms of healthy process. Just as I said in the previous episode, fear and doubts are simply ways of thinking, so by changing how we think with these very hard processes - we can break free from our chains, and BECOME GODS!
  And man, I just want to say that I've become a master of managing expectations. I couldn't possibly describe the amount of responsibility I have

Before then however

  Before I answer what expectations are, I want to begin by saying that you really shouldn't have any expectations to begin with.
  All that anxiety, depression and pretty much every other emotion under the sun, is because you've set some sort of expectation.
  So truly, a lot of the advice you're about to hear in today's show is about how we can actually think and act without expectation.
  When you think about, expectation isn't real. It's merely a coping mechanism, but it's also just an extra layer to process. Once you remove that layer, you will be so much more efficient with your day to day.


So, what are expectations?
  Essentially, expectation is a strong belief that something might happen. *
  Why is this negative for your life?
  Put simply, because expectations are not real! They are just beliefs.
  Why is this bad? Well, put simply, the moment you allow the ability to create flakey logic, humans will abuse.
  Guess what happens when you're feeling really stressed and hopeless, and you decide to set expectations? Well, naturally your expectations are going to reflect that, which simply ends up making you feel more stressed and hopeless.
  Expectations can work against you.
  So by managing expectations, what I'm ultimately saying is dissolving expectations. The problem, of course, being that we have expectations to begin with, as a behaviour we've learnt since birth


Here's the deal with expectations.
  If you want to know what expectations really are, they're just really crappy coping mechanisms.
  Like, they're shit. If you had to compare human feces with the soul of an expectation on a molecular level, they actually are made of the same meta-physical compound.
  -

Let's talk about some of the unhealthy expectations people have.
  For example, expectations which lead to mania like "I'm going to get super rich from bitcoin!" or ""
  Being excessively doubtful

  And what makes them suck even further, is when you realise that they're just beliefs.
  You can have people who have nothing wrong with them, but because they expect the world is going to end,



How to healthily manage expectations.
  To dissolve them, and that really is the alternative here.
    So the funny thing to realise here, is that there really is nothing to manage
  How do you do this? Really, it comes down to learning to be comfortable with yourself. Part of the reason why you're seeking expectation is because you don't feel comfortable with simply existing without belief.
  In large part, you may have become dependent on these beliefs in order to feel a sense of self-worth, in order to feel protected and when you think about it order to feel anything at all.
  You may simply not be used to being calm and just
