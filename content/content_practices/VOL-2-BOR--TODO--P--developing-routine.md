In this exercise we're going to be taking the initial steps towards developing a solid routine.

Part of the reason why people struggle with developing and sticking to routine is because they severely overcomplicate it. 

They assume it's all about developing an intricate, fool-proof strategy, when really it's much more fundamental than even having a strategy overall. 

Instead, 90% of the battle comes down to failing to stick to the motions of routine.

We commit for a few days, only to stop completely and continue ourselves complete unaffected.

In other words, we struggle to truly prioritise those things which are actually important to our lives, and it's a huge part of the reason why so many of us fail to progress.

Because we fail to understand what routine is. 

However once you realise it's nothing more than prioritisation, then it can become a lot easier to reason with from the point of view of action.

How do we learn to better prioritise ourselves?

Like anything else in life, it comes down to the fundamental principles of practice and consistency.

In our particular case, practicing maintain our own little routines in life, simply for routine's sake.

For example, it could be as simple as counting down from 10 anytime you need to go to the bathroom, or perhaps thinking about the colour purple before eating a meal.

Although this may seem silly, ultimately what this practice is teaching us is to prioritise and put our mental health first. 

Which isn't silly at all.

Often this means doing things which we struggle to see the value of, and so by learning the value of prioritisation we can better adopt these practices without the resistance of purposelessness or frustrating. 

That's why it's important to embrace this exercises, regardless of how absurd they may seem to you. 

In addition, this exercise also signifies the importance of trying new things, which is largely what we are doing with NeverFap Deluxe.

By learning new things we can learn to better adapt to new and more efficient ways of thinking, without feeling uncomfortable or resistant to change.

Futhermore, it simply makes practicing and adopting all these new skills much easier in the long-haul.

For this exercise what we will be doing is adopting a number of new routines for us to follow. 

And it may even help to write them down at first, so it's clear what you must do.

For example, you may want to create a routine where you must picture a dog everytime you need to go and open a door. 

Or perhaps it could be a less frequent occurrence where you create the rule that you must have your back to the mirror whenever you must brush your teeth.

What's truly important here is consciously engaging with your mind while practicing these routines, so that you're fully aware of them throughout your day.
