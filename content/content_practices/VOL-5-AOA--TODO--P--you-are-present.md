This exercise is really about understanding this idea of what it means to be truly present with ourselves. 

But what exactly does it mean to be present?

Contrary to popular belief, to be present is actually about completely letting go of all your thoughts, feelings and emotions.

Whereas a lot of people seem to have this idea that being present is about remaining focused, which fundamentally doesn't make sense.

Because it's impossible to be both focused and present with yourself at the same time, your mind only has the capacity to do one of those things.

However when you're able to completely let go, then you're able to be truly present with yourself, and arguably this is the intention of all these exercises on this website. 

Instead, what I want you to do with this exercise is really become familiar with this idea of who you are as a person.

When you're present with yourself, you're not just present with your mind. You're present with an individual which wears certain clothes and has a particular taste in music. 

In other words, what we want to do is really connect with this idea of 'self' in order to better understand that feeling of who you are.

Although a large part of NeverFap Deluxe is about learning to dissolve our ego, it's undeniable that our ego also an incredibly useful construct which helps us get through the day-to-day. 

Certainly, the goal of NeverFap Deluxe isn't so much to replace our ego, as it is to be able to have control over it and be able to dissolve it at will. 

The idea behind this exercise is to get closer and become more familiar with that identity, so we can better embrace it.

For this exercise what I want you to do is learn to be present with yourself. Which is to say, that person you identify with on a daily basis. 

It can help to imagine as if you're being with yourself in 3rd person.

There's nothing to question. Nothing to think about. You're simply aware, conscious and present with your own identity. 

This truly is a meditative exercise, which is designed to help center us.
