This exercise is all about understanding this idea of what it means to be truly present with ourselves.

In fact, porn addiction recovery is largely a process of self-discovery within itself, so there really is no alternative to dedicating your time towards practicing these meditative and introspective exercises.

Certainly, what I can say that self-discovery isn't something which simply happens on it's own. It's a process of putting one foot in front of the other, no different to any other endeavour in life.

Anyway, I digress.


{{< hr3 "So what exactly does it mean to be present with oneself?" >}}


Contrary to popular belief, being present is actually about completely letting go of all your thoughts, feelings and emotions.

It is a state of mind where you do not feel preoccupied by anything in particular, where you become free to actually see yourself and the world clearly.

Without the execess of thought or emotion to cloud your view.

Instead, I think a lot of people have this idea that being present is about remaining alarmed and focused, which fundamentally doesn't make sense from a mechanical point of view.

Because it's impossible to be both focused and free at the same time, your mind only has the capacity to be in one of those states at any given moment.

It's a bit like saying that a cup can be both empty and full, it's simply not possible. 


{{< hr3 "And when you're able to completely let go, then it affords you the opportunity to be truly present with yourself." >}}


Arguably this is the intention of all the exercises on NeverFap Deluxe, to help you learn to let go in some way so you can increase your capacity for awareness in a variety of situations.

However unlike other exercises, this particular exercise intends to be quite direct.

What we want to do is focus our attention on being present with ourselves, and really become comfortable with this idea of living without thought or distraction.

Certainly, it can help to understand that when you're present with yourself, you're not just present with your mind. 

You're present with an individual which wears certain clothes and has a particular taste in music, and which has a personality and life unique to that person.

In other words, what we want to do is really connect with this idea of 'self' in order to better understand this feeling of who you are, in this present moment. 

Because it's important that we learn to be present, not only when we're calm and collected, but also when our mind is completely distracted and in chaos.


{{< hr3 "There's this huge misconception about recovery that it must be perfect." >}}

And that every single meditation we do must achieve a certain state of clarity in order to be effective

This simply isn't true. 

Meditations where we're feeling completely distracted are often the most valuable, because it's like trying to run a marathon through a sandstorm.

Sure, it's going to be more difficult, but the skills gained are relative and will help you run even better when the conditions are right. 

Although a large part of NeverFap Deluxe is about learning to dissolve our ego, it's undeniable that our ego also an incredibly useful construct which helps us get through the day-to-day. 

Certainly, the goal of NeverFap Deluxe isn't so much to replace our ego, as it is to be able to have control over it and be able to dissolve it at will. 

The idea behind this exercise is to get closer and become more familiar with that identity, so we can better embrace it.

For this exercise what I want you to do is learn to be present with yourself. 

And in order to effectively do this, we must also be actively meditating and learning throughout the day to dissolve our thoughts and feelings, in order to be truly present with ourselves.

This truly is a meditative exercise, which is designed to help center us and learning to remain calm and without reaction can help you go a long way towards developing these abilities.

Which is to say, that person you identify with on a daily basis.

It can help to imagine as if you're being with yourself in 3rd person.

There's nothing to question. Nothing to think about. You're simply aware, conscious and present with your own identity.
