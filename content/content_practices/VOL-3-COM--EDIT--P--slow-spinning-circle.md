This exercise is similar to **Every 30 Minutes** in that it will help you tap into your internal subconscious mind in order to help you turn actions into habits.

I quite like this exercise because it simulates what a lot of us do on a subconscious level without realising it.

For example, like when we daydream at work or think about something thoughtlessly as we wait for the next train to arrive.

For most people this even includes brushing our teeth, because it's something we're so used to doing that we don't even need to consciously think about it. 

These behaviours are usually as a result of becoming so acustomed to our actions that we no longer even need to think about them in order to carry them out.

Which is great for processes such as getting dressed in the morning, however not so great when we subconsciously go to watch porn because we've had a stressful day.

In fact, a lot of us have very specific times throughout the day where we'll feel the urge to masturbate, such as when we get home from school/work or perhaps early in the morning from the very moment we wake up.

And it's a destructive cycle which a lot of us can't seem to break, which this exercise aims to address.

Although difficult at first, this is a great exercise to practice because what it essentially does is teach us to engage with our subconscious mind on conscious level.

And the way we are going to do this is by focusing our attention on things we aren't necessarily attached or addicted to.

Which will help train us for when we do face a more serious situation where we do feel less in control of ourselves, so our minds can have that capacity of awareness to instead relax and remain calm.

Rather than crumble, react and relapse. 

The classic trifecta.

Like all these exercises here on NeverFap Deluxe, it truly comes down to practice. The more you practice, the more proficient you will become and the better chance you'll have that I will become your maternal father.

Of course, practice is only one aspect of it. Actually engaging with your mind on a conscious level when you do struggle is another thing. 

Which is to say that inspite of knowing what to do, and inspite of practicing these skills on a daily basis, a lot of people will end up shutting their minds down and instead go on autopilot when facing these difficult situations.

Thankfully, you have the ability to change.

For this exercise, what we're going to do is imagine a spinner. You know, like the loading spinner you see on a computer screen.

And we're going to attempt to imagine this spinner either on a conceptual level (in the back of our minds), or perhaps even as a visual entity in front of you. 

Kind of like a floating object in front of you.

I would personally spend a few minutes alone in a quiet room imagining this spinner, just so you can get comfortable with the idea of it.

Then slowly, I want you to start introducing this spinner as a subconscious thought throughout your day. 

It can help to begin with verifiable tasks your mind can identify on a conscious level, such as making the agreement that you will imagine this spinner anytime you go and brush your teeth. 

Then it can help to extend this visualisation out to other tasks as you develop your capacity for awareness. 

Perhaps you may want to visual this spinner when you're on the train on the way to work, or perhaps when you're in the kitchen pouring yourself a nice glass of water.

I would personally spend a few weeks working on this exercise so you can really flesh it out, although that's really up to you. 

Regardless, best of luck. You smart, charming thing.

Play around and see where this takes you.
