I absolutely LOVE this exercise.

It's a great way to promote conscious action, and it's especially helpful at demonstrating the power of process as a driving force for change.

Over-thinking is a problem most porn addicts struggle with on a daily basis, and it's a problem which tends to grow worse over-time the longer they struggle with their recovery.



Because you know what desperate people without hard strategies do?

That's correct folks, they over-rationalise to compensate with the fact that they're utterly clueless.

Cluelessness which transpires into hopelessness, as they begin coming up with brittle logic in order to justify their dysfunction. 


"Is it okay to edge to porn if I don't masturbate?"

"Is it relapse if I have sex with a hooker?"


Like, what does any of this stuff have to do with developing Healthy Coping Mechanisms?

Well, this is precisely why I created this exercise so we can learn to take back control over the essential fundamentals which we may have been ignoring this whole time.

And reverse the years of rationalisation which may have plagued your porn addiction recovery process, for the worse. 

So what are these fundamentals exactly?

As NeverFap Deluxe states, it's all about sticking to the process and of course, most people are going to have an incredibly difficult time doing this if all they know is distrusting the process.

But that's okay. I've been there. I know what it's like. So let's change those behaviours and become better people.

Essentially what we want to do for this exercise is to carry out a bunch of tasks without thinking.

What a lot of people don't realise, arguably because they're so stuck in thought they haven't truly reflected in a long time, is that thought is just a tool.

Which is to say that thought is not the main course - it is just a tool to help us carry out the process.

Now, when you're spending more time thinking than following the process, then you have a problem.

What we are training ourselves to do is to embrace the power of process, without mentally meddling with the process in any way.
