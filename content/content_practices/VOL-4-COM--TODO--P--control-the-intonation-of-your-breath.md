Although it may seem like a simple breathing exercise, this exercise is all about developing our capacity for conscious awareness.

A key part of what makes NeverFap Deluxe effective is that it teaches you to be conscious, which is to say that it teaches you to use your mind in order to produce results.

Where most people fall apart is that they practice these exercises without truly being conscious, which is really no matter than not practicing them at all.

If you're not engaging with your mind, then you're simply not developing meaningful skills.

And I mean, I don't necessarily blame people. It can be difficult to engage with your mind, especially when you've relied on escaping your thoughts or distracting yourself as a primary coping mechanism.

But it's important we directly address the elephant in the room, otherwise you'll simply continue to mindlessly relapse or watch porn.

Mindfulness truly is a core concept when it comes to what we're trying to develop with these exercises, and this exercise is excellent at making this aware to you.

And a lot of what mindfulness comes down to is learning how to use our minds in a conscious way.

Certainly, our breath is a great place to start with this, because it's a subconscious behaviour we do which we often don't think about.

Yet, which we have direct control over. 

And so bringing these behaviours to our attention can help us train our brains to become more aware and mindful of other behaviours, such as when we find ourselves peeking at porn or fantasising in general.

The more you engage with your brain, the stronger your ability to act appropriately will become.

Whether that be refraining from reacting to a stressful situation, learning to dissolve our feelings and emotions at will, or even simply deciding to have 15 minutes to yourself to recalibrate. 

It all starts with our actions, and it can be incredibly hard to take action when we cannot conscious execute when it's required most.

For this exercise what we want to do is learn to breathe consciously, as well as really become aware of the control we have over our breath. 

Start by breathing slowly, paying close attention to the intonation of your breath. 

When you breathe in, and when you breathe out.

Remember that it really is about learning to be conscious with your breath, and a key part of this which a lot of people don't realise is that we can only be present with ourselves once we've first learnt to let go of our mind.

Which is to say that this whole process is going to become a lot easier once we've fully calmed down and arrived at a relaxed state.

Of course, perhaps you struggle with this exercise. Perhaps you feel unable to be conscious with yourself at all.

Well, only by consistently practicing this engagement with our minds can we hope to be able to engage with ourselves fluently.

It can help to understand that these are skills we are developing at the end of the day, skills which anyone can learn if they simply go through the motions. 

Then once you're more familiar with your breath, it can help to change the intonation of your breath, while continuing to remain calm and aware of yourself.

You are fully in-control of yourself. You just need to practice it.
