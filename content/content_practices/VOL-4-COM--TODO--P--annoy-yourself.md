<!-- ONE MORE EDIT -->

In order to understand what this exercise fundamentally aims to address, it can help to understand the dynamics of how we become annoyed within the first place. 

Because once you understand how it happens, the whole thing will become crystal-clear and you may even find it impossible to be annoyed again.

...or at the very least be able to recognise how silly the whole thing is, even if you find yourself caught up in the motions.

Given these are habits that we've likely developed since childhood, and which will take time to truly dissolve and understand.

Ultimately, the premise is quite simple.


{{< hr3 "You create a personal agreement which states that you will feel annoyed." >}}


And that's literally it.

What happens is that we create the agreement, then a particular circumstance fulfils that agreement, and then we feel the emotion.

Otherwise, known as "taking something personally".

Which when you phrase it like that, sounds as if it's your external circumstances which are causing you to feel that way, when really it's the agreement we've personally created which is responsible for how we feel.

The reason why the whole premise is silly is because the agreement can be literally anything.

You can say you're going to get really angry because the sky is blue, or that you're going to be feel really sad if you happen to see a cat.

It's a bit like when you see someone get really upset over something which you personally could care less about, like when someone absolutely loses their cool when the bus you're waiting for is 5 minutes late.

The reason why it's silly is because once you understand that it's your own personal agreement, then not only does it make you realise that you're merely reacting to a belief you've created in your own mind.


{{< hr3 "But it also exposes how willingly we'll allow ourselves to self-harm via our emotions, over a self-created agreement we've adopted." >}}


Which is insane.

The reason why people struggle not to take things personally is because they fail to identify when they create agreement. As well as when they fulfil the agreement.

Instead, what they do is identify the feeling.

And when all you can see the is that feeling, the very result of taking something personally, then inherently it will merely reinforce the validity of your experience as something that is out of our control.

Well, these feelings do not reflect what is actually going on. You do have control in these situations, because you created the agreement.

Ultimately the idea of something like awareness is that we're learnng to actually be able to catch ourselves when we create these agreements, so we can dissolve them and move forward.

Our end goal is to be able to dissolve and identify these personal agreements at will, and to live our life free of agreement. 

Self-created beliefs which take power away from our ability to remain neutral and in balance with ourselves.

With this context in mind, your task with this exercise is to try and annoy yourself, in order to understand on a conscious level what actually happens when you get annoyed. 

What makes you feel annoyed? What agreements have you personally created and which circumstances fulfil those agreements? 

While there's nothing to practice per-say, this exercise is more about getting you to consciously think about these things throughout the day. 

Certainly, what we are doing with this exercise is learning to think differently about how we react to our emotions, as something which we are responsible for.

And once you have this power, it can provide you with so much opportunity to avoid self-created suffering.

For example, I'm currently writing this article on the train and there's this lady who's playing music on her phone without headphones and initially it annoyed me. 

But if you make the agreement that this music is actually something enjoyable to be appreciated, then you no longer need to fight that resistance.

And you can just become a better person, more resilient person overall. 

Of course, part of the reason why we don't inherently do this is because we buy into the agreement instead. We don't have the self-awareness, nor understand to realise it's an agreement and so we just straight to the feeling and stay there.

With this exercise we are also trying to become more aware of when we do create agreements, so we can have more power over our actions. 

The funny thing about modern humans is that we've learnt to put our feelings first before our beliefs.

Which is to say that we automatically assume that our feelings are correct first, and that everything else is a consequence of that.

Observe, observe, observe.
