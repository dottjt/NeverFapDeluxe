<!-- ONE MORE EDIT -->

In order to understand what this exercise fundamentally aims to address, it can help to understand what it means to be annoyed.

Because once you understand the dynamics of how we get annoyed, your behaviours and reactions become crystal-clear you may even find it impossible to be annoyed again.

Well, at the very least help you understand why you may be feeling annoyed, as well as recognise how silly the whole thing is.

Essentially the premise is quite simple.


{{< hr3 "You create a personal agreement which states that you will feel annoyed." >}}


That's literally it.

Ultimately what happens is that we create the agreement, then a particular circumstance fulfils that agreement, and then you feel the emotion.

The whole process is known as "taking something personally".

Which when you phrase it like that, sounds as if it's the external circumstance which is responsible for how we feel, when really it's us and the agreement we've created.

The reason why it's silly is because the agreement can be anything

You can say you're going to get really angry because the sky is blue, or because .

The reason why it's silly is because when you understand that it's your own personal agreement, you realise that you're merely reacting to a belief you've created in your own mind.

Which is insane. This is literally what people in mental institutions do. They have conversations with themselves, and this really is no different.

{{< hr3 "The reason why people struggle with taking things personally so much is because they don't identify the agreement. " >}}


Instead, they identify the feeling and when all you can see the is the feeling, the very result of taking something personally, then inherently it will merely reinforce your experience as something that is out of our control.

Well, this simply isn't true. You do have control in these situations, because you created the agreement.

Ultimately the idea which something like awareness is that we're learnng to actually be able to catch ourselves when we create these agreements, so we can dissolve them.

So rather than have those internal conversations, our intention will be dissolve those personal agreements and identify them for what they are.

Self-created beliefs which take power away from our ability to remain neutral, which therefore takes power away from our ability to be free.

Your job with this exercise is to simulate that "when something happens" in your mind.

Part of the reason for this is so you can understand on a conscious level that you are creating this feeling, and that it's not a result of the something that's taken place.

We only believe that our feeling is a result of the thing that's taken place, because that's the lie we tell ourselves in order to justify this feeling.

The funny thing about modern humans is that we've learnt to put our feelings first before our beliefs.

Which is to say that we automatically assume that our feelings are correct first, and that everything else is a consequence of that.

Which of course, is incorrect.

Ultimately the aim of this exercise is to help you hook these agreements, and observe how you react to them.

Then once you understand this dynamic, it will provide you with a greater understand of how our mind truly works.
