Ultimately, this exercise is a direct follow up to **Identifying the feeling of obligation** so I highly recommend checking that exercise before practicing this one.

Although certainly you can practice this exercise alone.

What I like about this exercise is that it's a very direct and physical way of engaging with change.

It takes a lot of inspiration from other exercises such as **Stop Absolutely Everything You're Doing** in a more conditional way.

And in order for us to better understand what this exercise is all about, it can help to understand a bit more about this idea of human responsibility.

Which mind you, is an incredibly odd thing when you look at the dynamics of how it changes our perception of reality.


{{< hr3 "When someone is deemed "responsible" for something, it completely changes the way a person thinks, feels and operates. " >}}


All of a sudden, they are provided with an incredible amount of incentive and motivation to act in concert with these responsibilities, in a lot of cases as if their live depended upon it. 

For example, if we have a child to look after, it can feel as if we've been provided with an insurmountable task whereby we must do absolutely everything within our power to ensure that child remains safe.

Yet what's odd is that although that the very construct of responsibility is merely a self-created feeling.

Which is to say that nothing has actually changed. The only thing that's actually change is our attitude towards life.

Which is to say that responsibility is not something concrete. It is merely an expectation that we set for ourselves.


{{< hr3 "It's also why we don't pursue these same actions when we're feeling down or depressed, it's because we don't feel like being "responsible"." >}}


In essence, the reason why you end up looking after that child is because you feel obliged to do it, not because you necesarily have to in any capacity.

Sure, there are consequences. But there's literally nothing stopping you from walking out the door and never returning.

And this is incredibly important for us to realise, because the reason why we feel anxious or depressed is because we create these same feelings of obligation on other aspects of life.

We feel as if we have the "responsibility" to be highly successful in our career. We feel as if we have the "responsibility" to have an incredibly attractive partner.

We create all sorts of unrealistic expectations which drown us out and which make us feel miserable, all because we feel responsible to them. 

Well, this exercise essentially aims to challenge this responsibility and to help us understand that they are not real and that they are entirely self-created.


{{< hr2 "Instructions" >}}


This exercise is all about challenging our existing obligations and responsibilities.

In other words, what we want to do is directly disobey them, simply as a matter of principle.

For example, you may feel obliged to read your email at a certain hour, or to check your phone for messages every 5 minutes.

Don't.

Identify the feeling of obligation, then do the opposite. 

Certainly, a key aspect of this exercise is learning not to react. Because what happens is that we identify the obligation, then we begin to question what we're doing and rationalise it.


{{< hr3 "This is not challenging our obligation. This is reasoning with it." >}}


To challenge is to protest, and the best form of protest is learning to turn around and walk away. 

What can also help you through this exercise is to understand that it's a very healthy thing to challenge obligation, and that you grow as a person each time you successfully challenge an obligation.

Personally for me, what this exercise means is spending less time thinking, and more time committing to my schedule.

There's nothing particularly special about this exercise, it's simply that this isn't something which people think about. 

We pursue our habits and obligations for so long that we don't even realise we have an alternative. 

Well, you do have an alternative and I wish you best of luck with this exercise.
