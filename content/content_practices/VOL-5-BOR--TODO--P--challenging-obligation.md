<!-- Ultimately, this exercise is a direct follow up to **Identifying the feeling of obligation** so I highly recommend checking out that exercise before practicing this one.

Although certainly you can practice this exercise alone. -->

What I like about this exercise is that it's a very direct and physical way of creating change.

And it takes a lot of inspiration from other exercises such as **Stop Absolutely Everything You're Doing** in a more conditional way.

In order for us to better understand what this exercise is all about, it can help to understand this idea of human responsibility.

Which mind you, is an incredibly odd thing once you understand the dynamics of how it changes your perception of reality.


{{< hr3 "Once we're deemed \"responsible\" for something, it completely shifts our own understanding of what is necessary in life." >}}


For example, if we have a child to look after, it can feel as if we've been provided with an insurmountable task whereby we must do absolutely everything within our power to ensure that child remains safe.

Yet what's odd is that although we now have a child, nothing has fundamentally changed about who we are.

We're still alive. We still have a beating heart. You still have a mouth which can chew and a mind which can think.

Instead, what's changed is our attitude towards life, all because we've decided to embrace these self-created feelings of responsibility.

And once you realise that a large part of this idea of responsibility is nothing more than a feeling, then it can also help you understand that responsibility itself is something which can be easily manipulated. 

For example, when you're feeling down or depressed you may not feel like being responsible, which is to say that responsilibity itself is not perfect.


{{< hr3 "In essence, the reason why you end up looking after that child a lot of the time is because you feel obliged to do it, not because you necesarily have to in any capacity." >}}

Now, sure.

Perhaps children aren't the best example since they're something you inherently love and there are severe consequences to neglecting your children, but there's literally nothing stopping you from walking out the door and never returning.

And this is an incredibly important point for us to realise, because by the same token, the reason why we feel anxious or depressed is because we create those same feelings of obligation in other aspects of life.

We can feel as if we have the "responsibility" to be highly successful in our career. We feel as if we have the "responsibility" to have an incredibly attractive partner, or to be incredibly smart.

Yet these are all merely self-created expectations we set for ourselves, which drown us out and which make us feel miserable.

All because of a self-created feeling we attach to, which ironically doesn't actually help us achieve our goals. 

The good news is that once you understand that our poor mental health is as a result of these expectations or "responsibilities" which we create for ourselves, then it can help us move forward and realise that they are not real and can be challenged and dissolved.

So we can learn to be truly present with ourselves instead.

<!-- Which is to say that we've decided to set certain expectations for ourselves, because we personally allow external circumstances to dictate how we feel.  -->


{{< hr2 "Instructions" >}}


This exercise is all about challenging our existing obligations and responsibilities.

In other words, what we want to do is directly disobey them, simply as a matter of principle.

For example, you may feel obliged to read your email at a certain hour, or to check your phone for messages every 5 minutes.

Don't.

Identify the feeling of obligation, then do the opposite. 

Certainly, a key aspect of this exercise is learning not to react. Because what happens is that we identify the obligation, then we begin to question what we're doing and rationalise it.


{{< hr3 "This is not challenging our obligation. This is reasoning with it." >}}


To challenge is to protest, and the best form of protest is learning to turn around and walk away. 

What can also help you through this exercise is to understand that it's a very healthy thing to challenge obligation, and that you grow as a person each time you successfully challenge an obligation.

Personally for me, what this exercise means is spending less time thinking, and more time committing to my schedule.

There's nothing particularly special about this exercise, it's simply that this isn't something which people think about. 

We pursue our habits and obligations for so long that we don't even realise we have an alternative. 

Well, you do have an alternative and I wish you best of luck with this exercise.
