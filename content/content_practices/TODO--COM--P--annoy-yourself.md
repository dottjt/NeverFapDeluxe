In order to understand what this exercise fundamentally addresses, it can help to understand what it means to be annoyed. 

And certainly, once you realise how silly it is, it will change the way you think about your own personal beliefs and how we use them to create feeling. 

If you haven't read my articles which touch upon judgement, then that's probably a good place to start. I know I've done a podcast on it as well, in case you wanted something a bit more vocal.

The way annoyance works is deadly simple, yet it's something almost no one understands. 

After all, it's really hard to get annoyed once you understand how it works, because it ultimately ruins the point and fun of being annoyed.

Here's how it works.


{{< hr3 "You create a personal agreement that you will feel annoyed when something happens." >}}
  

That's literally it. 

The reason why it's silly is because when you understand that it's your own personal agreement, you also realise that you feeling annoyed has absolutely nothing to do with the something that has taken place.

Instead, it's just you reacting to a belief you personally have in your mind. 

Which is hilariously insane, when you think about it. Like, outright delusional.

This is literally what people in mental institutions do. They have conversations with themselves, and this really is no different. 

So rather than have that internal conversation, our intention will be dissolve those personal agreements and identify them for what they are. 

Self-created beliefs which take power away from our ability to remain neutral, which therefore takes power away from our ability to be free.

Your job with this exercise is to simulate that "when something happens" in your mind.

Part of the reason for this is so you can understand on a conscious level that you are creating this feeling, and that it's not a result of the something that's taken place.

We only believe that our feeling is a result of the thing that's taken place, because that's the lie we tell ourselves in order to justify this feeling.

The funny thing about modern humans is that we've learnt to put our feelings first before our beliefs.

Which is to say that we automatically assume that our feelings are correct first, and that everything else is a consequence of that.

Which of course, is incorrect.

Ultimately the aim of this exercise is to help you hook these agreements, and observe how you react to them.

Then once you understand this dynamic, it will provide you with a greater understand of how our mind truly works.
