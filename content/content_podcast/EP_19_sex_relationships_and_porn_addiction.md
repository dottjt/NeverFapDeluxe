- In today's show, we're going to talk about sex and relationships!
  - We're going to talk about how porn addictions affects sex? Things like erectile dysfunction.
  - How porn addiction affects relationships, and how it changes something like our perception of our partners, both on a mental and physical level.
  - And that's really key and what I want to discuss today - porn and perception, and how porn changes that on a very fundamental level.

- Mental health update
  -


- What does sex have to do with porn addiction?
  - Almost nothing.
  - Porn addiction is a mental health issue.
  - It may affect your ability to have sex, but sex itself won't help you overcome porn addiction.
  - People do this because they want to have better sex, but it's the wrong approach.
  - You need to do this because you want to improve your mental health.
  - The same goes for anything in life, if you focus on the superificial aspects, you won't get anywhere.
    - Exercise: Being stronger, not looking better.

- Is porn addiction the reason why you struggle with sex?
  - Maybe. It really is an individual thing. *
  - It can affect performance for some people *
  - You could be new to sex * (talk about my own experience)

- Let's talk about relationships.
  - Porn definitely affects your ability to have and be in a relationship
  - The primary reason is because your mental health is being affected.
    - More insecure
    - Less confident
    - Less able to

- Good advice
  - Don't worry about finding sex or a relationship.
  - These things will come naturally once you have your mental health sorted.
