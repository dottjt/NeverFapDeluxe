In this episode I talk about choice, what it means, how you can exercise it and all things decision.


# Script 

- Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe podcast. 
  - My name is Julius Reade. 
  - Explain what podcast is about.
  - I run a website.
  - I run a Discord channel.
  - I run a subreddit. 
  - I have a Patreon.

- In today's podcast we're going to be talking about this concept of choice? Why, Choice, Mr. Reade? *Dun dun dun*
    - Because it's a huge point of confusion and in particular, doubt. Like, do I lose all my progress when I relapse?
    - In most cases, people just don't know what they even have choice over. So I hope to answer literally every single question you may have in regards to this. 
    - So really, what today's 
    - And it relates back to this idea of "Choice over mind" which is one of the five fundamental principles of NeverFap Deluxe. 

- Mental health update
  - 

- What is choice?
  - Choice is your ability to act.
  - Choice is something you have which you act.
    - Choice is a skill you develop
    - If you do not have the skill, you do not have the choice.
  - Practice and consistency is how you develop choice.
  - Awareness allows us to identify choice

- Thinking about choice in porn addiction
  - You have effective and ineffective 
    - Can help to keep it simple
  - To react, or not react.
    - Dealing with unbearable situations.

- Why do we make bad choices.
  - Because we don't know any better.
  - Because we fear and worry.
  - We don't understand the impact of our decisions.
  - Poor mental health. 

- How to make good choices.
  - It's all about fundamental principles. 
  - What goes against this is following emotions, feelings.
  - It's about understanding why things work the way they do.
  - Keeping choice simple
  - Sticking to the process


- Scenarios.
  - We have an extreme urges.
    - If we don't have the skill, then we don't have choice.
    - 





<!-- 

- Well, really you have two choices, and I can almost guarantee that you most likely have the wrong idea as to what is actually preferred. I mean unless if you've reading the website like a good boy, and girl, or boy, or girl, or boy, or girl, or boy ...or girl aaaaand that never gets old.


- Now instinctually, everyone's first response is to do something about it. You know, you're feeling sad, so you're like "Oh man, this is unbearable" so mentally you're like "Alright, I'm sad, ummm, I'm going to go do something productive or try and feel motivated" and so you're like trying to read a book, but mentally you're just not in the mood because you're sad, DUH, so we begin to panic and then we guilty because we're not functioning and we're wasting time, then that makes us feel worse about ourselves, then we spiral and then nek minute, you're down at McDonalds masturbating to Ronald McDonald!

- What's the deal with that? 
- The alternative on the other hand, is to relax and not react. 
- Now the reason why people don't do that is because porn addicts are afraid of their emotions. That's why you turn to porn, because you're not comfortable with how you feel. Which is understandable, if it's sadness or trauma and we're like, get out of da chopper, but at the same time it's not the right approach.
- The whole idea behind awareness and calmness is to teach us to be comfortable with our emotions, and to cope more effectively as a result. 
- You know, I talk to a lot of people and they're like, "Oh man, a huge trigger for me is when I'm alone or when I'm really bored" and what a lot of people don't realise, is that boredom or being alone are mindsets. Boredom, is the product of an unsettled mind, and literally nothing more. You are bored, because you are not comfortable when your emotions.
