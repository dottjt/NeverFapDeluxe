In this episode I talk about The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap Deluxe and how they can help you ovecome porn addiction.

# Script

- Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe podcast.
  - My name is Julius Reade.
  - So you might be wondering, what is this podcast about? Well, let me tell you, young stranger! it’s a podcast about overcoming porn addiction *
  - I also run a website called NeverFap Deluxe which aims to help people suffering from Porn addiction.
  - In addition, I also run a Discord channel where I run an accountability program to help porn addicts like yourself, get advice and information, as well as commit to daily awareness and meditation practices.
  - I also run a subreddit.
  - If you’d like to support the podcast, feel free to visit my Patreon (The easiest thing is if you just Google NeverFap Deluxe into Google)

- In today’s episode we’re going to be talking about the five fundamental principles of NeverFap Deluxe
  - The interesting thing is that when I first started NeverFap Deluxe, I actually built it around these five principles in mind. In fact, that was going to be the whole schtick of NeverFap Deluxe. You follow the principles, you cum into a jar, you’re golden!
  - It’s in part why a lot of the earlier articles on the website refer back to those principles, because, yeah.
  - Anyway, what I realised in the end is that meditation ultimately was a more important angle that sort of got overlooked by having those 5 principles, and I was like, you know, even though it’s easier from a marketing perspective to make these 5 principles, it really is about meditation and so I sort of put them aside.
  - But with that said, those principles are super important - so they’re making a comeback, baby!
  - So yeah, today we’re going to cover each principle in-depth. And, I’m sure I’ve already referenced them to some degree, so not all these concepts will be new to you, but they’re super important so it can help to have a bit of a refresher into them!

- Mental health update
  -

- So what do the five principles help you achieve? Well, they essentially help you achieve balance. The reason why I created them is because people overcomplicate porn addiction recovery. So I was like, let’s make it simple again. Let’s be like, “okay, I’m really struggling, but that’s okay, because I have these principles which can help guide me through it all.
  - Another important question to ask is, what makes a principle fundamental?
  - As I’ve written on the website, a fundamental principle is a hard truth. It is something which remains true irrespective of whether you agree with it, how you feel about it, nor even how you understand or interpret it.
  - For example, ice is cold. That’s a fundamental principle.
  - You can dispute it, you can argue against it - I don’t really care. Ice is cold. That’s just what ice is.
  - And I’ll tell you what, the number of people who try and fight me and tell them that I’m wrong when they’re the one’s who are addicted to porn, is hilarious! But that’s okay. It took me 5 years until I finally gave in an meditated. Certainly, I’m not perfect. But that’s okay, because that’s what we’re trying to address.
  - Just understand, that your skepticism and doubt doesn’t help the process.
  - In fact, we have a very specific word which describes those who reject fundamental principles: Delusional.
  - Don’t be delusional. The Reade is here to help, and in some cases, touch you and molest you.
  - In other words, the truly aim of these five fundamental principles is to help you expose the fact that there is something wrong with the way you currently think.
  - As a former porn addict, I encourage you to embrace the idea that everything you know about yourself is wrong, and to not fight the unfamiliar. Otherwise you won’t change. In fact, I’ll come and grab your children and sell them to the Chinese. Don’t be that guy.


- So what are these principles? Well, let’s go through them one by one.
  - I’ve sort of ordered these in terms of relative importance, so the first one we’ll discuss is what I consider one of the most important ones.
  - The first principles is called Choice over mind
  - What Choice over mind iterates is the fact that you have complete control over your mind. *
  - This is irrespective of whether you currently feel in control of your mind, whether you agree it's possible to have full control over your mind, or whether you've even experienced having full control over your mind.
  - What's important to understand is that your mind is fundamentally capable of being controlled.
  - For example, you may believe that you don’t have the ability to control your desire to stare at men or women in public. Incorrect. Again, this is a fundamental principle. You do have the capacity to develop this ability, you just need to learn how.
  - I’m here to tell you that with daily practice, you can learn to develop control over our mind, and completely filter the women we walk past in public altogether.

  - Largely, this is the kind of exercise you learn by meditating daily. If you meditate, you will


- The second principle is called Balance over reward
  - Balance is one of the key areas that porn addicts struggle with most, largely because we don’t respect it.
  - We don’t maintain our sleep schedule. We think it’s okay to peek and edge. We treat all these self-destructive behaviour as not being "that big of a deal", not quite understanding the consequences that ignoring balance can have on their life.
  - What Balance over reward maintains is this idea that we must prioritise balance over our immediate wants and goals.
  - Now, there’s many reason why we do this. We can become obsessed with something and choose to give that priority. Often it’s because we neglect ourselves because we’re depressed.
  - So we cut corners thinking we’re not losing out overall. WRONG. People don’t realise that the reason why they’re struggling is because of the corners that they’ve cut.
  - You’re not weak willed because you were too tired to prevent yourself from relapsing. That’s just inherently natural. You’re weak willed because you decided not to go to bed early.
  - And part of the reason why we do this is because we’re so focused on the outcome that we don't quite even realise that we're even doing anything wrong to begin with
  - And really, it comes down to this idea of reward. In a lot of cases, we simply

Rather, we feel justified in our actions, inspite of the fact that we recognise that we may have a problem with addiction or our mental health.

Even though a) Cutting corners makes you less productive overall than if you were functioning normally and b) Having the added effect of ruining your mental health physical health in the process.

Instead, by learning to respect the principle of balance in your life, you can actually get more done overall without burning out, and without the constant baggage of emotional volatility and stress.

I think part of the problem is that people fall into the trap of believing they're inherently unique when it comes to cutting corners.


{{< hr3 "They think they can somehow \"cheat\" the system and come out ahead." >}}

Put simply, it's impossible.

No one is immune to their own biology.

Even though people may not show it (in most cases, they simply know how to hide it very effectively), there is a hard limit to what everyone can do on a daily basis without it affecting their mental health.

The point is that if we are to overcome our porn addiction, we must respect this limit and embrace balance in everything we do.

This means taking breaks, even when we want to push forward. This means challenging ourselves, even if we don't feel like it.

And by learning to value and respect these boundaries, you may gain a significant amount of control over your life.


<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">03 - Awareness over all</div></span>
</div>


Awareness is absolutely fundamental to everything we do.

It is what allows us to identify and address the destructive patterns in our life, as well as serve as a stop-gap between our thoughts and our actions.

What **Awareness over all** maintains is that having awareness over our actions is critical to not only understanding the impact those actions may have over our own lives, but also how we can learn to gain control over them.

Without full awareness, we simply cannot hope to act with any amount of intention, nor understand the responsibility we have over them.

{{< hr3 "Instead, we allow our habitual thoughts, emotions and beliefs to take over and continue their self-destructive patterns." >}}

I think the reason why most people struggle with this concept of awareness is because:

a) They're not currently aware, nor understand how to be aware because it's not something they've ever practiced.

b) Most people struggle to even understand what this concept of awareness actually is. (I was certainly one of them)

In reality, awareness is actually really simple.


{{< hr3 "Awareness is your ability to sense the world around you." >}}

That's literally it.

It's not about focusing your mind or trying really hard not to think, or even trying to figure out how to empty the thoughts in your mind.

Certainly, they may be useful skills and they may be a consequence of practicing awareness, however the actual action of awareness itself is simple.

{{< hr3 "It is simply being present with your senses." >}}

Pretty neat, huh?

And when you're present with your senses and what you're feeling, it provides you with the ability to control and gauge your experience.

Witout reaction, and without taking what you're experiencing it personally.

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">04 - Struggle over none</div></span>
</div>

Essentially, the basis of this principle is that the simplest path is often the most efficient.

And as humans, we instinctly do what we find most simple, either for better or worse.


{{< hr3 "Therefore, solutions which are simple by design are going to be more effective than solutions which are convoluted." >}}


It's the reason why I personally follow the paleo diet and only eat one meal a day.

Doing this is vastly more simple than counting calories, obsessing over when I can eat and organising three meals a day.

In other words, simple is often easy.


{{< hr3 "Certainly, part of the reason why we're addicted to porn in the first place is because it's the easy thing to do." >}}


Back to the principle itself, what <u>**Struggle over none**</u> relates to is this idea that if you're really struggling with someone, then you're probably not doing it right.

Which means either you're not understanding it intuitively, or you're fundamentally misunderstanding what you're trying to understand.

For example, understanding that porn recovery isn't about fighting yourself or forcing yourself to "get through it".

If at any point you feel like you have to force yourself to do something, then it indicates that you're doing something incorrectly or more importantly, not actually recovering from porn addiction.


{{< hr3 "Because life without porn isn't a struggle." >}}


It's actually one of the most liberating and empowering things you can do.

The takeaway being that life only ever becomes a chore when we act against it or neglect it.

Especially when it comes to addressing porn addiction.

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">05 - Uncondition over judgement</div></span>
</div>

Much like Balance over reward, this is one of those principles that people tend to ignore, because they underestimate the ramifications of ignoring it.

<u>Uncondition over judgement</u> is about pursing acceptance over judgement.


{{< hr3 "What a lot of people don't realise is that judgement is a mental trap." >}}


Because when you make a judgement, you essentially trap yourself into a limited point of view.

Of course, the reason why it may not seem like a mental trap is because at first, making one judgement isn't going to kill you.

But humans never just make one judgement.

We make thousands of judgements each and everyday, each time moulding our perception of who we are and what we know.

And when we make enough of these judgements, they can form into habits of belief which prevent us from exercising awareness.

{{< hr3 "After all, how can you be aware of what's going on in your mind, if your mind is in a constant state of habitual thinking?" >}}

The more judgements you make, the more awareness you trade, and the more faith that gets placed into ideas of who you are and what the world is.

It becomes a trap because without realising it, through judgement you end up in a state of habitual unawareness, full of harmful behaviours that we have no idea how to control or influence.

Now imagine trying to address something like porn addiction under this state of mind.

It becomes almost impossible.

Because guess what happens when you invest all your faith into a bunch of fruitless ideas?

{{< hr3 "You end up having no capacity to address the problems in your life which actually has meaning, like your porn addiction." >}}
