- Today's episode: masturbation and orgasm
  - How do those things affect our recovery?
  - Is it okay to masturbate and orgasm?
  - Is it normal outside of the context of recovery?

- Mental health update
  -

- The naturalist argument
  - People argue our bodies are designed to masturbate, therefore it's healthy.
  - I argue that natural is whatever you want it to be
  - NFD is about discovering that we get to choose what is natural.
  - If you want it to be masturbation, then fine.
  - However, we need to also think in terms of NFD principles.
    - We are about making it easy
    - We are about stability

- What does it mean for something to be healthy?
  - I would say it's more about well-being, than it is about function.
  - A lot of people say they're highly functional, but you might have bad mental health.
  - It can help to think in terms of lifestyle.
    - Masturbation is more than just something you do. You have to factor in how it changes your lifestyle.

- So, is masturbation healthy?

- Here's why I don't recommend masturbation
  - In fact, there are two reasons.
  - (Talk about orgasm and how that affects control)
  - (Talk about how masturbation doesn't help you develop control over your emotions)

- Tak in terms of coping mechanisms. Mastubrtaion in the context of porn addiction is unhealthy, because we use it as an UHC
