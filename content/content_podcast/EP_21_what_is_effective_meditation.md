1. How I started out with meditation.

  - Start when I was around 20.
  - Did nothing for me (elaborate)
  - I now realise it's because I wasn't doing it right.
  - In addition,

2. What is meditation? Why is it important?

- To understand meditation, we need to understand balance (explain)
  - Meditation is the easiest way that I know to achieve balance (explain)
  - What is balance?
    - Calmness, Awareness, ambition (elaborate)
    - Meditation teaches you those things, all in the one exercise.


3. What are some of the misconceptions of meditation?

- Most people I know struggle with meditation (because of misconceptions)
  - What are these misconceptions?
    - Meditation doesn't work (address)
    - Meditation is religious thing (address)
    - Prayer is a substitute for meditation (address)
    - We are already aware (address)
    - I already exercise, workout and read (address)

4. How do you meditate?

- This is the hardest question to answer (elaborate)
  - Why is it hard?
    - Here's my analogy - It's kind of like asking a master pianist - How do you play piano? (explain)
  - It's about starting with the basics
    - The most basic way, and what I recommend, is to observe your senses (explain)
    - It can help to undersand what effective meditation is
      - It's consistent.
      - It's highly conscious and aware.
      - It's calm and relaxed.

5. How people struggle with meditation

- The main thing is that people do it completely wrong.
  - They think it's this tense thing that's about concentration and perfection (elaborate)
