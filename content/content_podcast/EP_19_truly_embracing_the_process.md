In this episode I talk about how you can truly understand and embrace the process.

# Script

- Today we're going to talk about process.
  - What is process? *
  - Why people struggle with process * 
  - Because once you understand process, you understand recovery *


- The bigget problem with process is that it's not how people traditionally think.
  - People think in terms of goals, not process *


- If I had to describe like to think of the process as the best friend you never had. 
  - Because you don't know them.
