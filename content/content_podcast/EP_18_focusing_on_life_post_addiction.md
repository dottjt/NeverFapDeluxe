In this episode I talk about what you can expect once you overcome your porn addiction, and more on what it's like to live ambition.


# Script

- In today's episode we'll be talking life post-addiction
  - You know, what it's like to be free of addiction

- A good question to begin with, am I fully recovered from porn addiction? 
  - Well, once you truly come to understand porn addiction recovery, you realise it's a silly question. 
  - It's not possible to be fully recovered *
  - Instead, it's a bit like saying am I fully recovered from hunger, or poverty. Instead, these are things that you work towards everyday *
  - 

- With that said, I am fully recovered from porn addiction * (talk about skills)
  - 




- Let's talk about ambition.
