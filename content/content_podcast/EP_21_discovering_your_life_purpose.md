In this episode I talk about life purpose and what that means to have purpose, at least within my own life.



# Script

- In today's episode we're going to be discussing purpose, because it seems to be something people struggle with while battling addiction
  - What does it mean to have purpose? *
  - How does having purpose change you? *
  - What can you do to create purpose in life? *
  - Furthermore, how I derive purpose in my own life.

- Mental health update
  - 

- Purpose is what you want it to be.
  - And I really want you to understand the significance of what this means, because people spend their entire lives not understanding what purpose is. 

- How I derive purpose
  - Personally I derive purpose from process, so that's why I teach it so much.

- Why others people struggle with purpose.
  - One of the main reasons why people struggle with purpose is because they misunderstand process.
  - Like I've said in previous episodes, people don't think in terms of process, they think in terms of goals. *
