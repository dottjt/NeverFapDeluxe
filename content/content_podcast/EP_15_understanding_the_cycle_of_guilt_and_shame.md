# Script

- Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe podcast.

  - So you might be wondering, what is this podcast about? Well, let me tell you, young stranger! it’s a podcast about overcoming porn addiction *
  - I also run a website called NeverFap Deluxe which aims to help people suffering from Porn addiction.
  - In addition, I also run a Discord channel where I run an accountability program to help porn addicts like yourself, get advice and information, as well as commit to daily awareness and meditation practices.

- In this episode I talk about how best to assault women. I'm kidding! (use a baseball bat). Seriously, don't do it. (Go for the kitchen knife, and cut her face open). Incorrect!
  - Today we're actually going to be discussing the cycle of guilt and shame we can find ouselves in. 
  - And you know exactly what I'm talking about. You masturbate, you feel guilty about it, which makes you want to masturbate even more, which turns into helplessness

- Mental health update
  - 

- What is guilt?
  - Guilt is defined as a deep feeling of remorse for an act which may or may not have occurred in the past.
  - In large part, because we feel as if we've done something wrong, that we deeply regret. (list examples *)
  - In the context of porn addiction, it essentially comes from watching porn (*)
  - Why we feel guilt is for a wide number of reasons
    - For example, because we know it's a form of self-harm *
    - Because we know on some level it's bad for society and the people involved *
    - Because of the self-judgement we feel, for being unable to change *

- Where does the guilt come from? 
  - 
  

- The key thing to understand about guilt is that we create it.
