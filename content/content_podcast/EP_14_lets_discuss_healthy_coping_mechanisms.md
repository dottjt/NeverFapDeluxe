1. Introduction

- Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe podcast. 
    - My name is Julius Reade. I’ve got a bit of a spoiler, but I’m actually your true father. That other guy, he’s actually a pedophile, and I’m so sorry you had to find out listening to a porn addiction podcast, but I’m here now. Ready to play catch with my boy. 
    - So you might be wondering, what is this podcast about? Ya bastard. It’s a podcast about overcoming porn addiction, you know, because you can’t stop tugging’ it. 
    - I also run a website called NeverFap Deluxe which aims to help people suffering from Porn addiction.
    - In addition, I also run a Discord channel where I run an accountability program to help porn addicts like yourself, get advice and information, as well as commit to daily awareness and meditation practices.
    - I also have a subreddit. r/NeverFapDeluxe. It’s a great place to post nudes and hook up with desperate guys who can’t stop watching porn. 
    - If you’d like to support the podcast, feel free to visit my Patreon (The easiest thing is if you just Google NeverFap Deluxe into Google)
