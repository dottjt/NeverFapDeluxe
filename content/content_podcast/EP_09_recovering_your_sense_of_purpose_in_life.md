In this episode I talk about purpose, how we lose it and how we can learn to cultivate it in our lives.

<!-- 
# Script

- Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe podcast.
  - My name is Julius Reade.
  - Explain what podcast is about.
  - I run a website.
  - I run a Discord channel.
  - I run a subreddit.
  - Personal coaching.

- Today we're going to be talking about purpose! 
  - The reason why is because it's been an insane month essentially. 
  - What is purpose?
  - How do we discover our purpose in life?
  - How we lose purpose?
  - What are some of the key principles of purpose?
  - Talk about the past few weeks.

- Mental Health Update
  - How I lost purpose, as well as how to deal with having purpose.
  - How has it been? Both terrible and positive.
  - I got the flu, it was the hardest thing I've ever dealt with.
  - Completely destroyed my sense of purpose.
  - It's hard to have purpose when you have no opportunity to function. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't think. Both mentally and physically I was not only limited, but incapable.
  - I couldn't even meditate.
  - One of the ways I coped with that was to shut down and remain as calm as possible. Essentially, learn not to react.
  - Of course, what's arguably harder is once you're no longer sick and you're trying to rediscover yourself again.
  - The good news is that I'm 100% back to where I need to be. Primarily, because I have my sense of purpose back.

- What is purpose?
  - Purpose is what drives you (vital). Without purpose you are a hollow shell.
  - Oddly it's not something people think about.
  - Often you don't realise how important purpose is until you lose it.
  - The difference between being effective and ineffective.
  - In a way, purpose is a map. It points out absolutely everything you need to know about yourself.
  - From a feeling perspective, it is an overwhelming sense of confidence in who you are and what you do in life.
  - It is a sense of understanding.
  - It is what makes life feel intentional.
  - Fundamentally, I treat purpose as a skill. It's something which you can create, if you have the ability.

- How do we lose purpose?
  - We can forget about it. (sickness, too busy etc.)
  - Poor mental health. (lose control over our emotions, overationalisation, judgement etc.)
  - Bad circumstances.
  - Fear and doubt in who we are.
  - They misunderstand process. 
  - Of course, you may have never felt a sense of purpose before.
  - Coming back to the map analogy, there's a few things we can lookout for.
    - Perhaps your map is incomplete. - maybe there's still quite a lot about yourself that you don't yet know.
    - However you have to be careful that you don't rationalise.

- Key principles of purpose.
  - It's something you cultivate. (practice and consistency)
  - It's also whatever you want it to be.
  - It's not something you own, it's largely a mindset
  - It can disappear as easily as it can appear in life.

- What can we do once we lose purpose?
  - It comes down to creating an environment where purpose can flourish.
    - This means sticking to the process.
  - You can't force life, but you can increase your chances.
  - Of course, like I said earlier, purpose is a skill. So it's about learning that skill.
  - The way you do this is by sticking to the basics
  - Are you meditating daily? 

- The best piece of advice I can give people is to not take anything personally.
  - An easy way to lose purpose is to focus your attention on those feelings of depression, sadness. 

- How I derive purpose
  - For me, purpose is laregly a mindset
  - Personally I derive purpose essentially from what I do with NFD.
  - But really, it's actually a lot more fundamental than that.
  - I derive purpose from anything I do. I make sure that anything I do, I'm aware, I'm happy, I've got a positive attitude.
  - Focusing on the small things in life.
  
- So what can you do to rediscover purpose?
  - The best thing you can do is learn to let go.
  - In a lot of cases, it's not so much about discovery, as it is about learning to let go of our fears and 
  - Talk about drawing (how fear and perfectionism can ruin that drive)
  - The same thing applies to our mental health
