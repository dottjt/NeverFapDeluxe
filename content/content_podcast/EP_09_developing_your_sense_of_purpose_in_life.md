- Mental Health Update
  - How I lost purpose, as well as how to deal with having purpose.
  - How has it been? Both terrible and positive.
  - I got the flu, it was the hardest thing I've ever dealt with.
  - Completely destroyed my sense of purpose.
  - It's hard to have purpose when you have no opportunity to function. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't think. Both mentally and physically I was not only limited, but incapable.
  - I couldn't even meditate.
  - One of the ways I coped with that was to shut down and remain as calm as possible. Essentially, learn not to react.
  - Of course, what's arguably harder is once you're no longer sick and you're trying to rediscover yourself again.
  - The good news is that I'm 100% back to where I need to be. Primarily, because I have my sense of purpose back.

- What is purpose?
  - Purpose is what drives you (vital)
  - Without purpose you are a hollow shell.
  - The difference between being effective and ineffective.
  - In a way, purpose is a map. It points out absolutely everything you need to know about yourself.
  - From a feeling perspective, it is an overwhelming sense of confidence in who you are and what you do in life.
  - It is a sense of understanding.
  - It is what makes life feel intentional.
  - Fundamentally, I treat purpose as a skill. It's something which you can create, if you have the ability.

- How do we lose purpose?
  - We can forget about it. (sickness, too busy etc.)
  - Poor mental health. (lose control over our emotions, overationalisation, judgement etc.)
  - Bad circumstances.
  - Fear and doubt in who we are.
  - Of course, you may have never felt a sense of purpose before.
  - Coming back to the map analogy, there's a few things we can lookout for.
    - Perhaps your map is incomplete. - maybe there's still quite a lot about yourself that you don't yet know.
    - Perhaps you've


- Key principles of purpose.
  - It's something you cultivate. (practice and consistency)
  - It's not something you own, it's largely a mindset
  - It can disappear as easily as it can appear in life.

- What can we do once we lose purpose?
  - It comes down to creating an environment where purpose can flourish.
  - You can't force life, but you can increase your chances.
  - Of course, like I said earlier, purpose is a skill. So it's about learning that skill.
  - The way you do this is by sticking to the basics
  - Sticking to the recovery process
