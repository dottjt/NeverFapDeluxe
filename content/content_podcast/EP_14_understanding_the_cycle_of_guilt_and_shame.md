# Script

  - Explain what podcast is about.
  - I run a website.
  - I run a Discord channel.
  - I run a subreddit.

  - The cycle of guilt and shame.
  - You masturbate. You feel guilty. Self-reinforcing cycle.

- What is guilt?
  - Deep feeling of remorse for an act which took place.
    - List Examples
  - It is a coping mechanism
    - Gives you purpose
    - Allows you to rationalise what took place
      - Example

- Guilt in context of porn addiction 
  - Why 
    - We know it's self-harm
    - We feel it's bad
    - It's what we've always done

  - How we respond
    - Self-judgement, self-criticism
    - 

- Key Point: Guilt is a feeling.
  - Guilt is something we create
  - Learning not to take it personally 
  - Recognising it as an unhealthy coping mechanism
