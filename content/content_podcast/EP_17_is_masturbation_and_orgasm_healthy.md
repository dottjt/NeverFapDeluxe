In this episode I talk about masturbation and orgasm and whether these things are healthy within the context of overcoming porn addiction.

# Script

- Here's why I don't recommend masturbation
  - In fact, there are two reasons. 
  - (Talk about orgasm and how that affects control)
  - (Talk about how masturbation doesn't help you develop control over your emotions)


- Tak in terms of coping mechanisms. Mastubrtaion in the context of porn addiction is unhealthy, because we use it as an UHC
