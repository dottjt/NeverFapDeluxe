In this episode I talk about masturbation and orgasm and whether these things are healthy within the context of overcoming porn addiction.

# Script

- In today's episode I thought I'd talk more about masturbation and orgasm, and how those things affect our porn addiction?
  - Is it okay to masturbate and orgasm? *
  - Is it normal to mastrubate and orgasm? I mean, it's what our bodies are designed to do? *
  - Ultimately, what I hope to do with this show is to change the narrative in regards to how we think about masturbation and orgasm, because currently it seems people have an overly positive or overly negative P.O.V #trigger, so let's have a meaningful discussion about that.

- Mental health update


- So, is masturbation healthy?
  - I get a lot of people telling me it's normal/healthy, but it's a lot more intricate than that.
  - And to make the statement that anything in life is natural, is horribly misguided. 

- Here's why I don't recommend masturbation
  - In fact, there are two reasons. 
  - (Talk about orgasm and how that affects control)
  - (Talk about how masturbation doesn't help you develop control over your emotions)
