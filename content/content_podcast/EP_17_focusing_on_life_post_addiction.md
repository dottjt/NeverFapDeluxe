    - Energy is everything

    - Many people think you can't be in control.
    - They are wrong.

- What I personally do

- Let's talk about ambition.
  - Ambition is your eagerness and desire for personal development.
  - Separates us as individuals
  - Healthy ambition vs Unhealthy ambition
    - Healthy ambition is stable
    - Healthy ambition is understanding

- How to know you're recovered?
  - It's not possible to be fully recovered
  - It's a bit like saying am I fully recovered from hunger, or poverty. Instead, these are things that you work towards everyday
  - It comes down to skills. Do you have the skills to avoid relapse easily?
