- A good question to begin with, am I fully recovered from porn addiction? 
  - Well, once you truly come to understand porn addiction recovery, you realise it's a silly question. 
  - It's not possible to be fully recovered *
  - Instead, it's a bit like saying am I fully recovered from hunger, or poverty. Instead, these are things that you work towards everyday *

  - Life is purpose
  - It's your drive to experience
