In this episode I talk about the value of practice and consistency in helping us develop healthy habits in life.


# Script

- Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe podcast.
  - My name is Julius Reade.
  - Explain what podcast is about. I come to your house, and I eat your children.
  - I run a website. It's got words on it. 
  - I run a Discord channel. It's like a place where you type, and chat. 
  - I run a subreddit. A great place to make fun of porn addicts.
  - I have a Patreon. Let's make Reade rich again.

- Before I begin, I have two updates:
  - Firstly, sorry for not doing the guided meditations (explain)
  - Secondly, I've invented/come up with a new way to meditate! It's called hovering! (explain)

- Today's episode: Practice and consistency.
  - It's a super important concept. It's a fundamental principle.
  - What is effective practice?
  - What does it mean to be consistent.
  - Why is The Reade so damn sexy?

- Until then however, let's approach this week's mental health update.
    - I have some sad news everyone, however it turns out that I have prostate cancer, LOL JKS, it's actually AIDS, LOL JKS, it's actually back to cancer ....aaaaand I apologise if you have either of those things, although obviously I'm The Reade, it's what I do. You know, what's he gonna do next!?
    - If I had to describe my past two weeks, I would say that it's been about learning to let go.
      - Talk about how I struggle to let go.
      - What I've learnt (it's about making difficult decisions)

- So, onto the main course. You starving carivore. You sick child. Well, here's the meat of the episode for you to chunk into.

- Practice and consistency are fundamental concepts.
  - Meaning they are hard truths. (explain)
  - Meaning they work if you simply do them.

- Let's start with practice. What is practice and why it's important?
  - To understand this, you have to understand that mental health is a skill.
    - Learning to remain calm, not taking things personally, consciously directing your mind, not reacting to your emotions - all skills.
    - Skills are learnt through practice.
    - In life there are two things: Actions and consequences. 
      - Practice is the action. What you learn is the consequence.

- Where most people go wrong is they misunderstand this or doubt it. 
  - For example, you practicing something for 5 minutes and thinking it's pointless, is you misunderstanding practice. 
  - It's misunderstanding how the brain works from a neural perspective.

- What should you be practicing?
  - Essentially, healthy coping mechanisms.
    - Meditation. If you're not meditating, you will not overcome your addiction. Period.
    - Obviously if you've ever watched my online sex tapes, you'd know that meditation is ABSOLUTELY essential! I don't care what you think about meditation. I don't care if it was your mother's last dying wish to never meditate. If you are not meditating, you will lose.
    - Creating a daily routine helps tremendously.
      - (talk about my routine)
    - But again, it comes down to the fundmentals.
      - 95% calm, 5% awareness
      - not reacting to your emotions

- How to be consistent?
  - Consistency is all about learning to trust the process.
  - Which means, knowing that if you put one foot in front of the other, you will move forward.
  - Worry about the future is not trusting the process. People think of the destination, not the process.
    - Problem: People rely on motivation. Which is your emotions.
    - Emotions come and go.

    - People misunderstand commitment.
        - Committment isn't feeling motivated and having that warm n' fuzzy feeling you get from cuddling a baby pig. You cute, bacon little thing.
        - And actually, this is a huge, and I mean HUGE fallacy people have when it comes to addressing their porn addiction. They assume it's all about feeling motivated.
        - Like you gotta be feeling energetic and motivated to literally do everything in life, and not only is a lie, but it's exhausting.
        - It's not about feeling motivated or happy: instead, it's about being balanced, and it's important to understand that they are completely different things.


- People think they need to know. 
  - Porn addiction isn't a knowing, it's a doing.

  <!-- 
  - Obviously, how we can get into a routine of consistent practice, you know, doing things like meditation, remaining calm and aware, E T BLOODY C. Obviously, meaning etcetera.
  - We're going to have a delicate little chat, you know a 1 on 1, 1V1 me bro, about why we may struggle to be consistent. Perhaps because a certain someone whom I shall not name (obviously yourself) has relapsed, and is now drinking milk straight from the bottle!
  - Not to mention, we're going to talk about some of the things we should be practicing.
