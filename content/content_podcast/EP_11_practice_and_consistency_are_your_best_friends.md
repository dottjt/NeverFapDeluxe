In this episode I talk about the value of practice and consistency in helping us develop healthy habits in life.


# Script

- Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe podcast. 
  - My name is Julius Reade. 
  - Explain what podcast is about.
  - I run a website.
  - I run a Discord channel.
  - I run a subreddit. 
  - I have a Patreon.

- In today's episode we're going to be talking about the foundations of practice and consistency.
    - Obviously, how we can get into a routine of consistent practice, you know, doing things like meditation, remaining calm and aware, E T BLOODY C. Obviously, meaning etcetera.
    - We're going to have a delicate little chat, you know a 1 on 1, 1V1 me bro, about why we may struggle to be consistent. Perhaps because a certain someone whom I shall not name (obviously yourself) has relapsed, and is now drinking milk straight from the bottle!
    - Not to mention, we're going to talk about some of the things we should be practicing.

- Until then however, let's approach this week's mental health update.
    - I have some sad news everyone, however it turns out that I have prostate cancer, LOL JKS, it's actually AIDS, LOL JKS, it's actually back to cancer ....aaaaand I apologise if you have either of those things, although obviously I'm The Reade, it's what I do. You know, what's he gonna do next!?
    - 


- So, onto the main course. You starving carivore. Well, here's the meat of the episode for you to chunk into.

- Practice, Consistency, what is it all about? Well, let's start with the basics of what overcoming porn addiction is about.
    - Now, obviously I talk a lot about awareness and calmness, but these are just highlevel concepts.
    - What truly under pins those concepts is the process, and that's
    - If you've read the guide on the website, you'd know that the process is everything. If you trust the process, you will be fine. If you distrust the process, you will turn into ectoplasm and Donald Trump will come over to your house and orgasm into your eye.

- Now, what practice and consistency represent is your commitment to the process.


- So what is commitment all about. Well, what might help is to understand what commitment isn't.
    - Committment isn't feeling motivated and having that warm n' fuzzy feeling you get from cuddling a baby pig. You cute, bacon little thing.
    - And actually, this is a huge, and I mean HUGE fallacy people have when it comes to addressing their porn addiction. They assume it's all about feeling motivated.
    - Like you gotta be feeling energetic and motivated to literally do everything in life, and not only is a lie, but it's exhausting.
    - It's not about feeling motivated or happy: instead, it's about being balanced, and it's important to understand that they are completely different things.

- This is important to keep in mind, especially if you're the kind of person who struggle with motivation. Cause guess what? You're struggling with it because you're placing all this faith into it, when as I've said, it's absolutely not the point.

- So what is the alternative to motivation? Well, the alternative is quite simple. Instead, it's about learning to put one foot in front of the other, and that's literally it. If you literally put your left foot in front of your right foot, you will get to the door. It's no different with your recovery. If you follow the steps, you will get to your destination. If you keep it simple, then you also make the process accessible and within your reach.

- Let's talk about a basic and furthermore, healthy routine that we should be practicing.
- Obviously if you've ever watched my online sex tapes, you'd know that meditation is ABSOLUTELY essential! I don't care what you think about meditation. I don't care if it was your mother's last dying wish to never meditate. If you are not meditating, you will lose.
- Why? Because meditation teaches you both awareness and calmness, all within the space of 10 minutes per day! Dayum son!
