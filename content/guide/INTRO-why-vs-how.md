“Why am I a porn addict?”

Gaining an understand into why we are the way we are can be interesting, but to be quite honest, it’s an angle that’s a complete waste of time, and that won’t help you recover from porn addiction.

In fact, trying to understand why something is the way it is, is one of the biggest traps that people fall into. It’s like trying to figure out how to hold a cup by asking “Why is my hand designed to hold things?” or trying out what your life purpose is by asking the question “Why do I exist?” Why you exist has no correlation to what purpose you have in life. You can have purpose for absolutely any reason imaginable and likewise, you can be a pornography addict for any number of reasons. 

In fact, there’s a word used to describe what it means to ask ‘why’ all the time. It’s called rumination, and I personally consider it a form of self-harm. 

Rumination is when you over

Understandably it is an instinctive human response to ask ‘why’ something is the way it is. Through questioning we can create logic and reason, allowing us to paint a clearer picture of the world around us. 

The main reason however, why asking why is a pointless endeavour, is because it has absolutely no bearing over what you must do in order to overcome your pornography addiction. 

Ultimately, we are all human, and we all require the same set of skills to achieve certain goals. Sure, understanding why something is may help you understand which skills you may need to develop, however any comprehensive approach is going to cover all skills required anyway. 

In the case of basketball, it’s learning to shoot, block and run with the ball. It doesn’t matter if you’re of Turkish descent, had five siblings, was hit by a car at age 12, can barely speak English etc. Those are the core skills you are going to have to learn, one way or another.  

Another way of putting it is that we must focus on the how, rather than the why. When we focus on how to achieve something, we are no longer concerned with trying to define our reality. Instead, we are actively focused on the actions which help us change our reality for the better. 

In other words, ask yourself: “How am I a porn addict? What is it that I do on a daily basis which makes me a porn addict? How can I avoid porn addiction?”

But changing the way you think from trying to understand reason, to trying to understand tangible processes, you also completely change the way you think about your problems. They no longer become about building narratives or perceptions of who you are, and instead become focused on the mechanical details of what makes you drawn to porn.

Because at the end of the day, addiction is a process. 

It’s something you actively engage with and contribute towards on a daily basis. Attempting to understand why you have this process is a really indirect way of trying to influence the way it functions. And this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. 

To be a little bit more precise, here are a list of the why’s which you don’t need to worry about: 
- Why am I a pornography addict?
- Why do I find pornography addiction is so difficult?
- Why can’t I stop staring at her. 

These are all pointless questions. Instead, these are the types of questions we need to be thinking about:

- What can I do to influence my pornography addiction?
- What are the steps leading up to when I watch porn?
- How do I think about women?
- How do I fall into the trap of believing that it’s okay to watch porn?
