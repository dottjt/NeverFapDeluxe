What's a NeverFap best case scenario? 

Well, below I've gathered a list of metrics that reflect a very healthy attitude towards life and porn addiction.

- You no longer watch porn.
- You no longer crave watching porn.
- Pornography isn’t something you ever think about, at all. 
- You no longer stare at women in public. You don’t even notice them.
- You see women as other human beings, no more special than you.
- You no longer judge other human beings, including yourself. 
- You have control over your mind and thoughts. 
- You’re conscious of your feelings and emotions. 
- You’re happy with yourself and accept every single aspect of who you are.
- You’re comfortable with your emotions, both positive and negative. 
- You’re confident because you understand yourself. 
- You don’t engage in self-harm of any kind.
- You’re motivated and ambitious.
- You’re committed to your mental health.

Fancy pants.

### If it weren't for the fact that lists like these are utterly meaningless.

Here's the deal, soldier.

We're going to try something a little different here at NeverFap Deluxe.

Rather than concern ourselves with ideals and goals, what we're going to do is instead focus on processes.

In other words, we're going to focus on the things we can do everyday in order to improve as a person. 

Because at the end of the day, there really is no such thing as an 'ideal outcome' or 'best case scenario' when it comes to addressing porn addiction.

There is only you and the improvements that you make each and every single day.

That is why much of the content on this website is built around verifiable practices, so that you can actively improve and make changes to your life.

For example, a big trap that a lot of people make is concerning themselves with the number of days it's been since they last relapsed. 

Now, what on earth does this have to do with porn recovery? How is worrying about your past failures going to help you be a better person?

On the otherhand, concerning yourself with what you personally did that day to improve your resistance to watching porn, is wonderful.

The primary reason why it's wonderful is because it builds your awareness on the things you did right, which helps you make future correct decisions.

This is why it's important to journal your efforts and which practices you did that day, so you can acknowledge on a daily basis what you achieved and how it made you feel.

Remember.

Practice. Practice. Practice.

### Consistent hard work and practice are the only ideals which you should strive towards. 

Everything else is pure fluff, no matter how impressive it may sound in a list of achievements.

Because I can assure you that I don't live my life according to a list of ideals that my brain is in constant surveillance of.

Instead, I follow fundamental principles. I work towards them on a daily basis. 

And seemingly everything just appears to work somewhat magically.

That's the magic of simplicity.
