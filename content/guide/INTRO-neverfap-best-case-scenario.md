Originally this article was going to be about my upbringing. I wanted to write about my past, my previous trauma and help you understand how that may have contributed towards my porn addiction. However, halfway through writing it, I came to the realisation that everything I’d experienced before is completely irrelevant to who I am today. Largely, because the skills you end up learning have absolutely nothing to do with your past, hence why you don’t have those skills to begin with.

So instead, I’m going to write about the present. Who I am today, and how I’ve changed over the years. 

With all this in mind, what does a successful NeverFap outcome look like?

- You no longer watch porn.
- You no longer crave watching porn.
- Pornography isn’t something you ever think about, at all. 
- You no longer stare at women in public. You don’t even notice them.
- You see women as other human beings, no more special than you.
- You no longer judge other human beings, including yourself. 
- You have control over your mind and thoughts. 
- You’re conscious of your feelings and emotions. 
- You’re happy with yourself and accept every single aspect of who you are.
- You’re comfortable with your emotions, both positive and negative. 
- You’re confident because you understand yourself. 
- You don’t engage in any self-harm activities.
- You’re motivated and ambitious.
- You’re committed to your mental health.

While I’m certainly no angel when it comes to all aspects of my life, I can confirm that I tick most of the boxes above. 

One important point that I would like to emphasise is that a lot of those things actually have nothing to do with porn addiction. For example,  you don’t necessarily require a porn addiction in order to be unmotivated. You can certain be unmotivated without a porn addiction. 

Which is also to say that a lot of the skills we will be developing have nothing to do with porn addiction at all. 

In a sense, pornography addiction has very little to do with pornography itself. 

While pornography itself is an addictive behaviour, much in the same way that alcohol, gambling and video games can be addictive, this doesn’t help explain why some of us find pornography to be so terribly destructive. 

To answer that question, we instead need to take a look at some of the beliefs that we may have developed throughout our lives, which may have influenced the way we feel about sex, women, pornography and most importantly, ourselves. 

In reality, porn addiction is a symptom of something greater. It is the result of misunderstanding on multiple levels. We are misunderstanding what women are. We are misunderstanding what happiness is. We are misunderstanding the value of time and in a lot cases, misunderstanding . 

Only by correctly these things can we 


Struggle sport

An important point I want to bring up, that I think is often misunderstood, is that if porn addiction is something that you consistently struggle with, then you’re most likely doing something wrong.
