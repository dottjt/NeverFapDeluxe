The NeverFap method of addressing porn addiction is comprised of five core principles. 

Each principle maintains a purpose, along with a range of associated skills which you must develop.

Without mastery of all five principles, we cannot hope to consistently maintain a life without porn, at least with any amount of consistency.

Before we begin however, we must ask ourselves a very important question: 

**What is a fundamental principle and what makes it fundamental?**

A fundamental principle is a hard truth. It is something which remains true irrespective of whether you agree with it, how you feel about it, how you interpret it, nor even how you understand it.

Sure, you may attempt to dispute it or argue otherwise, but doing so won't help you overcome porn addiction. Which is the reason why you're here, is it not?

Certainly, while everything is subjective to a degree, these principles are not open to thinking such as:

"Well, my mind doesn't work like that" or "While that may be true, I personally don't allow it to affect me". 

**This is called denial.** 

This is what we are trying to address with these five fundamental principles.

In essence, these principles have been designed to expose is the fact that there is something wrong with the way you currently think.

And to help you understand that it is because of the way you think, that you are addicted to porn.

I encourage you to embrace this idea, that everything you know about yourself is wrong, and to not fight the idea.

You cannot get better if you cannot improve as a person if you do not first recognise that you have a problem. 

## The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap

On a superficial level, none of these principles seem to have anything to do with addressing porn addiction. 

For example, there are no fundamental NeverFap principles along the lines of "Never visit a porn website ever again" or "Limit orgasming to sex only".

A large part of the reason why this is the case is because porn addiction has very little to do with pornography or even masturbation itself. 

Rather, porn addiction is merely a superficial symptom of a wider range of personality traits which the NeverFap method aims to address.

Without further ado, here are the five fundmental principles of NeverFap: 

<ul class="five__principles__list">
  <span class="five__principles__item__wrapper"><li class="five__principles__item">Choice over mind</li></span>
</ul>

While all these principles are important, this is perhaps the one that people struggle with most (I only speak from personal experience).

The reason why people struggle with it is because as a porn addict, you are in denial.

Essentially what <u>*Choice over mind*</u> means is that you have complete control over what you want to think and believe.

This is irrespective of whether you currently feel in control, whether you agree with this notion, or even if you've experienced the exact opposite in your life. 

Your mind does not function without your intention.

You have complete control over mind, or put it in other terms, you have the ability to develop complete control over your mind.

How do you do this?

Largely, through controlled meditation, which this website will draw upon heavily. 

One common example that porn addicts struggle with (particularly male porn addicts) is that we will have a tendency to stare at hot women in public. 

It's almost as if we can see them a mile away, and in most cases it doesn't even feel as if we have a choice. 

We know they're there, we look, and we repeat this behaviour so many times that we believe that we don't even have a choice. 

This is simply not true.

With practice and control over our mind, we can learn to completely filter out women from our minds altogether.

Now imagine how powerful that would be?

<ul class="five__principles__list">
  <span class="five__principles__item__wrapper"><li class="five__principles__item">Balance over reward</li></span>
</ul>

Balance over reward is something which few people are aware of, even if they think they are. 

Well, in most cases, it's something we outright ignore because we don't think it's that big of deal. (As you may tell, denial is a big theme amongst porn addicts).

What <u>*Balance over reward*</u> maintains is this idea that balance is critical. 

Period.

It's critical for our basic functioning as human beings, it's critical for our mental health and it's critical for avoiding self-harm. 

It's critical irregardless of whether we think we can somehow 'cheat' being unbalanced or whether we 

Because guess what? 

Neglect of this balance is part of the reason why you're a porn addict.
