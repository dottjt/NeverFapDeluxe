The NeverFap method of addressing porn addiction comprises of five core principles. 

Each principle maintains a purpose, along with a range of associated skills which you must develop in order to address your porn addiction.

Without mastery of all five of these principles, we cannot consistently (nor easily) hope to manage the emotions, thoughts, feelings and beliefs which contribute towards our behaviour.

Before we begin however, we must ask ourselves a very important question: 

### What is a fundamental principle and what makes it fundamental?

A fundamental principle is a hard truth. It is something which remains true irrespective of whether you agree with it, how you feel about it, nor even how you understand or interpret it.

It simply is.

Sure, you may attempt to dispute it or argue otherwise, but doing so won't help you overcome porn addiction. Which is the reason why you're here, is it not?

A key thing to understand is that fundamental principles are not open to thinking such as: "Well, my mind doesn't work like that" or "While that may be true, I personally don't allow it to affect me in any way". 

### This is called denial.

This is what these five fundamental principles aim to address:

The fact that you are in denial about some aspect of your life, which is causing you to misunderstand yourself and result in obsession with porn.

They are designed to expose the fact that there is something wrong with the way you currently think.

As a former porn addict, I encourage you to embrace the idea that everything you know about yourself is wrong, and to not fight the unfamiliar.

You cannot get better if you cannot first recognise that you have a problem. 

## The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap

On a superficial level, none of these principles seem to have anything to do with addressing porn addiction. 

For example, there are no fundamental NeverFap principles along the lines of "Never visit a porn website ever again" or "Limit orgasming to sex only".

A large part of the reason why this is the case is because porn addiction has very little to do with porn, nor even masturbation itself. 

Rather, porn addiction is merely a superficial symptom of a wider range of personality traits which NeverFap aims to address.

Without further ado, here are the five fundmental principles of NeverFap: 

<ul class="five__principles__list">
  <span class="five__principles__item__wrapper"><li class="five__principles__item">Choice over mind</li></span>
</ul>

While all these principles are important in their own right, this is perhaps the one that people tend to struggle with most.

Essentially what <u>*Choice over mind*</u> relates to is the fact that you have complete control over your mind.

Remember, as a fundamental principle, this is irrespective of whether you currently feel in control of your mind, whether you agree it's possible to have full control over your mind, or even if you've never experienced being fully in control of your experience.

The way this is achieved is through controlled meditation, which this website will draw upon heavily. 

<!-- Of course, truly understanding that you have choice over your mind is a fundamental shift in what you believe.  -->

For example, many porn addicts (particularly male porn addicts) have a tendency to stare at hot women in public. 

It's something porn addicts struggle with because they feel as if they don't have a choice but to stare. 

Well, this is simply not true. 

With daily practice, we can learn to develop control over our mind, and we can learn to completely filter out women in public altogether.

Now imagine how powerful that would be?

Because I can let you know from first hand experience, that the freedom is pretty awesome. 

<ul class="five__principles__list">
  <span class="five__principles__item__wrapper"><li class="five__principles__item">Balance over reward</li></span>
</ul>

This is one of those concepts that people think they understand, and yet refutely do not because they're not actually aware of how unbalanced they are to begin with.

In fact, it's something most people outright ignore because they don't believe it's that big of a deal.

Which again, is a behaviour which can only be described as denial.

What <u>*Balance over reward*</u> maintains is this idea that we must prioritise balance over our goals.

Often when we become affixated with something, either through obsession or neglect, we fail to consider the wider ramifications of our actions.

So we cut corners in order to achieve what we want quicker, only to face the consequences of our actions later. 

I think part of the problem is that people fall into the trap of believing they're inherently unique when it comes to certain aspects of life.

They think they can somehow "cheat" the system and come out ahead.

In regards to porn addiction, we can think that porn and masturbation will make us happy, at the cost of our emotional and mental stability.

And when we're addicted to something, we only ever focus on that "reward", rather than maintaining wider happiness through emotional stability. 

This kind of thinking also applies to other areas in our life. 

A huge example (which I can personally relate to) is pushing yourself too hard. 

I am the kind of person who will overwork themselves to death, and in the past I didn't quite realise that I was necessarily doing anything wrong in doing so. 

Now, I realise that it was a key factor in the reason why I struggled with porn addiction so much.

Instead, by learning to respect balance in my life, I've been able to live my life more effectively, without any of the downsides.

The point is that there are hard consequences to everything we do, whether we truly understand it or not. 

And learning to value and respect these boundaries, will pay you dividends in the amount of control you will gain over your porn addiction.

<ul class="five__principles__list">
  <span class="five__principles__item__wrapper"><li class="five__principles__item">Awareness over all</li></span>
</ul>

Awareness is absolutely fundamental to everything we do.

It is what allows us to identify and address the destructive patterns in our life.

What <u>*Awareness over all*</u> maintains is that you must have awareness in absolutely everything you do.

Without full awareness, we simply cannot hope to act with any amount of intention.

Instead, our habitual thoughts, emotions and beliefs take over and they continue the self-destructive behaviours we are trying to address.

What awareness truly does is act as a stop-gap between you and your actions. 

The way we develop awareness, much like 

If I had to describe what awareness actually is, I would say it encompasses your ability to stop being human.

Which is to say that you can only be truly aware of something if you are personally detached from it.

Therefore, it is impossible to be both a porn addict and aware.

<ul class="five__principles__list">
  <span class="five__principles__item__wrapper"><li class="five__principles__item">Struggle over none</li></span>
</ul>

This one is real simple.

Essentially, the easiest path is often the most efficient.

And humans instinctly we do what they find easiest, either for better or worse.

Therefore, solutions which are simple and easy by design, are going to be the ones that we adopt.

What <u>*Struggle over none*</u> relates to is this idea that if you're really struggling with someone, you're probably not doing it right.

Because living a life without porn shouldn't be a struggle.

It should be one of the most liberating and empowering things you can do.

And if you're really struggling with it, then it suggests that there's some aspect which you're misunderstanding or going about the wrong way.

Porn recovery isn't about fighting your emotions or violently pushing yourself to become something you're not.

Instead, it's the complete opposite. It's about understanding who you are so that you no longer need to fight. 

Because when you actually think about it, the only reason why you're a porn addict is because you're constantly fighting yourself mentally.

Not necessarily in regards to porn itself, but in regards to some other aspect of your life which is resulting in you watching porn. 

The point is that the normal, natural state of being human isn't a chore.

It's only becomes a chore because we are either acting or neglecting upon some aspect of misunderstanding in our life.

Target the root cause and you won't even have to do anything. Your cravings and desires will literally melt away. 

Of course, this isn't to say there isn't a lot of work involved in targeting that root cause and addressing it in an appropiate manner. 

<ul class="five__principles__list">
  <span class="five__principles__item__wrapper"><li class="five__principles__item">Uncondition over judgement</li></span>
</ul>

This idea relates to how we should think.

<u>Uncondition over judgement</u> is this idea that critical judgement of any kind is detrimental.

Not only the act of judgement itself, but also how it changes the way you think about things.

What a lot of people don't realise is that judgement is a mental trap.

Quite a lot of things happen in your mind when you engage in the act of judgement.

For starters, you exchanging your ability to be aware, because when you make a judgement, you also place your faith into that idea.

Hopefully you have a better idea of what the Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap are, as well as what they represent.

They exist to help guide you through your porn recovery journey, and help you make healthy decisions.

If ever you get confused about anything, it can help to come back to these five principles and try to assess what you might be doing incorrectly.

Because at the end of the day it is not impossible to overcome porn addiction.

You just have to know exactly what you're doing and why.
