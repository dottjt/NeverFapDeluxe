Ultimately, the NeverFap method of addressing porn addiction is comprised of five core principles. Each principle maintains a purpose, along with a range of associated skills which you must develop.

Without mastery of all five principles, we cannot hope to consistently maintain a life without porn, as will soon be explained. 

On a superficial level, none of these principles seem to have anything to do with addressing porn addiction. For example, there are no fundamental NeverFap principles along the lines of "Never visit a porn website ever again" or "Limit orgasming to sex only".

A large part of the reason why this is the case is because porn addiction has very little to do with pornography or even masturbation itself. Rather, porn addiction is merely a superficial symptom of a wider range of personality traits which the NeverFap method aims to address.

Without further ado, here are the five fundmental principles of NeverFap: 

## Choice over mind


## Balance over reward


## Awareness over all


## Struggle over none


## Unconditional over judgement




- Choice over mind
