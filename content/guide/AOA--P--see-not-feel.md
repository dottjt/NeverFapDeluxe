This is an exercise that porn addicts benefit from greatly.

It is designed to help you change the way you understand what you see right in front of you.

<hr />

## Context

<hr />

The intention behind a lot of these exercises is to assist you in breaking down what you understand.

You see, what you "understand" is incorrect. What you "understand" is that absolutely must watch porn. What you "understand" is that you don't have the self-control not to watch porn. 

If you understand that you are worthless, for example, then that is how you are going to live your life.

Of course, whether that's true or not is completely irrelevant.





Seeing is not a feeling. The feeling is what we do with what we see.
