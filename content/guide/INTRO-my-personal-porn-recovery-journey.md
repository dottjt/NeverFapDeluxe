So you're probably wondering.

### Who on earth is this kid?

I'm a writer, marketer, designer (as I'm sure you can tell by the website), web developer, as well as an avid entrepeneur.

Probably much like yourself, I came across porn at a very young age. In fact, from the very moment I figured out how to masturbate at the ripe age of 10.

I'm not exactly sure when I decided that I wanted to give up porn, but there have been various serious attempts through out my life.

My very first attempt at giving up porn began at age 16, when I thought I'd just try it for the hell of it.

I managed to not watch porn for approximately 3 weeks, which was pretty amazing at the time.

It then wasn't until I was around 20 years old that I began to recognise that porn was an actual problem. 

A problem which I was determined to understand and overcome. 

<h3>Age 25. October 20th 2018.</h3>

That is the last time I have and ever will masturbate or watch porn again.

You know when you have that moment when everything clicks in your head, and absolutely everything comes together and makes sense? 

Well, that day actually came a few weeks after that day in October (which I will explain soon).

So changed over the years?

It's hard to say exactly why I had that moment, but up until that point I was:

- Did the whole Paleo diet thing
- Studied various books and perspective course on mental health
- Took cold showers everyday before bed
- Ate only one meal a day (via intermittent fasting)
- Did Leangains and lifting weights three times a week
- Was in an amazing, supportive relationship
- Worked obscenely hard to get a job as a programmer

Like, I was essentially do everything I could have done right, and yet probably 90% of that had nothing to do with why I managed to successfully give up porn.

## The truth of giving up porn addiction

I suppose there were two actual verifiable reasons why I'd managed to successfully give up porn. 

And it all happened within the space of a few weeks. 

### For starters I had a breakdown. 

You see, I suffer from a condition from Bipolar Disorder and I hadn't told my partner about it. 

In part, because I thought she already knew, yet one day I was feeling particularly vulnerable and it all came flooding out, because I felt as if I had to tell SOMEONE.

She had no idea. 

Even though we'd been together for around four years up until that point.

Coming out about my disorder was an incredibly important thing for me to do for a variety of reasons.

Now that she was aware of my disorder, I could now be honest about all the things I was hiding from her, including my porn addiction.

Because let me tell you, it's really hard to overcome something when you're hiding it from everyone, especially when you're telling them that you're not doing the thing that you're hiding.

Not only does the guilt eat away at you, but without having someone to talk about it with, it's hard to ask for help when you need it most. 

Understanding and recognising my disorder, which I'd previously dismissed, helped me better understand my emotions and therefore, not take them personally in the worst of times and 

The main benefit however was the sense of confidence it gave me to actually approach my problems.

It's like I finally felt free to just move on with my life.

### The second thing which fundamentally changed my ability to handle my porn addiction was meditation.

I'd literally only started meditating a few weeks after my last attempt at quiting porn.

And yet, I can say that within two weeks of meditating <u>I'd learnt more about how to manage my porn addiction than in absolutely everything I'd done in the past five years to try and curb my addiction</u>.

Absolutely incredible. 

If I had one piece of advice to anyone wanting to seriously overcome porn addiction, **start meditating today**.

Of course, it's foolish to claim that everything else I did up until then didn't have any impact on my ability to address my porn addiction.

Because it did.
