The idea that you don't have time for your mental health is bullshit.

Because if you truly did't have time for your mental health, then it also means that you would't have time to engage in self-harm behaviours such as watching porn.

Now think about all the time you've spent not being happy and 

I guarantee that it's a fraction of the time you'll spend working on your mental health each day. 

We need to get out of our heads that mental health is optional. 

Mental health is not optional. 

Your mind is the most powerful thing you have, and to neglect it is pure insanity.
