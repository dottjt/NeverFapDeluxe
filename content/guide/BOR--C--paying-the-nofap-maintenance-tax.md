While I’ve provided some context into what porn addiction is, let’s really get into the meat of things and discover some of the lessons I’ve personally had to learn in order to deal with my pornography addiction in a controlled and comfortable matter. 

So what exactly is this maintenance tax?

Well, aside from the fact that it's a term I've more-or-less made up on the spot, the maintenance tax refers to the time and effort required in order to maintain our physical and mental health. It includes things like showering, exercising, relaxing, studying, meditating, eating and brushing our teeth. Everything that helps us keep regular. 

The reason why I call it a tax, is because it’s something most of us don’t enjoy doing. We don’t view it as a necessity. In fact, most of us can tend to view these things as a burden, despite the positive benefits they provide.

So what ends ups happening is that become selective about what we view as necessary or not. Maybe we don’t exercise, because we’d rather be studying or playing video games. Maybe we work or study too hard, because we don’t see the value in meditating or relaxing.

In doing this, we make significant compromises on our ability to function and what’s really disturbing, is how utterly unaware we are of how much our ability to function is being compromised, even though it may be staring us in the face.

Certainly, I’ve been there and it’s only now that I’m paying the maintenance tax in full, do I realise how I was making something like giving up porn addiction, almost impossible due to my own actions and attitudes towards self-care.

In other words, if you’re struggling with porn addiction, it’s because you’re not fully paying the maintenance tax. 

In order to demonstrate this, I’m first going to talk about where I personally was making compromises in my life and what effect that was having on my life, in addition to how to successfully pay the maintenance tax.

### Facing the consequences of imbalance

Prior to this realisation, I was under the impression that I was relatively functional and healthy. I was exercising three times a week. I was eating healthily. I was in a fantastic relationship. I was incredibly passionate about studying (I was studying to become a coder) and I was full of ambition, ready to take on the world. 

Yet on the other hand, there were other aspects of my life that were severely imbalanced. Aside from being addicted to porn, I would have anxiety attacks over my coding. In fact, I was coding so much that I would have these ‘coding nightmares’ where I would be mentally coding in my sleep, but stuck in a continual indefinite loop given I couldn’t save the progress in my brain. I was obsessed. 

Now, please keep in mind that this is also a bit of an extreme. You see, I suffer from bipolar disorder.  

My problem was that I was pushing myself too hard and I didn’t provide myself with the opportunity to relax. 

Of course, you may have an opposite problem. You may not be motivated enough.

Instead, I treated all the negative aspects of 

### The key take away 

Embracing self-care requires a change in attitude. 

Instead of thinking about our immediate wants, we need to begin thinking holistically and understand that cutting corners of any kind, is going to result in future pain. 

It's going to cost us time in the long run. It's going to cost us emotional stability in the long run. Which exponentially increases the difficulty of everything else we hope to achieve. 

Only by paying the maintanence tax can we 

The key takeaway from this article is that self-care exists above all and that self-care is not optional. From now on, it is a hard requirement. By avoiding self-care, we delay the inevitable. 

### Self-care routine

So after all this, you're probably wondering what an optimal self-care routine is? 

Well, I suppose a good place to start is with what I personally do on a daily/weekly basis. From there, I can extrapolate upon which aspects I believe are most important.

- I eat paleo.
- I do cardio and lift weights three times a week.
- I have a consistent sleep routine.
- I work on my hobbies and ambitions in my spare time.
- I play video games and watch TV to relax.
- I meditate approximately three times a day.
- I work a typical nine-to-five job.
- I brush my teeth in the morning and at night.
- I have a cold shower every night.

These are the things that I do on a daily basis which keep me regular.

Now an interesting thing to note is that realistically, in terms of achieving NeverFap, you don't need to do most of those things. In fact, I was personally doing most of those things while still being a pornography addict. 

In fact, it wasn't until I began adding meditation to my routine that I was finally able to overcome my porn addiction. 

So it's quite possible that all you need to do to overcome porn addiction is to learn to control your mind through meditation.
