This exercise is one of the easiest ways to start building your awareness. 

Essentially, it involves slowing down your mind so that you can have the opportunity to be aware.

<hr />

## Context

<hr />

One of the most common ways we weaken our ability to be aware, is by losing control over our thoughts.

And the reason why we lose control over our thoughts, is because it can become incredibly difficult to even notice their existence when they're zooming around in our head.

Which inevitably after a while, become part of our subconscious, and a merely instinctual reaction - which is the exact opposite to control.

And is largely how porn addiction works, as a subconscious reaction which we don't necessarily think about, yet desire through out our day. 

For this exercise, we're not intending to identify these thoughts, nor even be aware of the impact of these thoughts.

We're simply going to focus on the raw process of thinking and how we can slow that down internally. 

In doing so, we can learn the physical sensation of what it actually means to be in control of our mind, and use this as a strong foundation for being able to control what we think. 

<hr />

### Because when we're in control of our mind, it's almost as if everything is moving in slow motion.

<hr />

The key thing to understand here is that having control over our minds isn't necessarily about being able to react to what's in front of us, but instead, prepare us for what will happen ahead of time 

The idea being that we can catch ourselves and identify these patterns before it becomes unmanagable.

Because when our minds are racing, it can become incredibly difficult, if not impossible to slow it down.

What you will learn by practicing to slow your mind down on a regular basis, is that racing through your thoughts is not only futile, but self-destructive.

But also to become a more calm and relaxed person. 

<hr />

## Exercise

<hr />

When you have a moment, just slow down your mind. 

This tends to work best when you're in the middle of doing something, because that's usually when your mind is engaged and requires relaxing. 

Of course, you can also practice it when you have the time, however
