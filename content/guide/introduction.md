Today I’m here to talk to you about porn addiction.

Porn addiction itself can be a very complex topic. We can spend hours discussing the intricacies of how particular cultural upbringings affect the way we view women. We can bore over the details of our past trauma in order to extract why exactly we’re so obsessed with certain types of porn. We can do all sorts of things to try and understand why we humans are the way we are, and to be quite frank... it’s all very exhausting.

Because the truth is, overcoming pornography addiction can be deceptively simple. In fact, it is deceptively simple. I spend around thirty minutes each day practicing meditation, and that’s literally it. With consistency you can basically knock it out of the park and regain control over yourself within a few months.

Sounds dumb? Well guess what. As someone who was once obsessed with pornography like cannot believe, I no longer think about porn. I no longer crave porn. I wouldn’t even want to masturbate to porn if you put it in front of me. Porn itself doesn’t trigger me and I really could care less about it. That, I would say is not very dumb.

And this is coming from someone who suffers from Bipolar Disorder, which should traditionally make something like overcoming porn addiction almost impossible.

Well, I’m here to show you that it’s not, even if you do suffer from extreme mood ds

You see, the actual process of obtaining something isn’t all that difficult. Becoming a body builder or a world class artist requires nothing more than constant practice. You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it. There are thousands of tutorials on the internet which describe in excruciating detail, how to achieve those things. And with enough practice, you are guaranteed to get there.

What’s difficult is a) Figuring out how to actually convince yourself to commit to those goals and b) Figuring out in the first place, what will work and what will not.

And yet, even with this knowledge in mind, making informed decisions as to what those steps should be can be an almost impossible task. Everyone has a different opinion of everything. Everyone is coming from a different point of view. Most of them coming from people who are currently addicts, and inevitably you’re going to get lost. Which is why we end up running around in circles for years before getting anywhere, spending a lot of energy sabotaging ourselves and making things worse.

So what hope is left?

Well, that’s why I decided to write this guide. My intention is to help you fill in all the gaps, so you don’t have to run around like a headless chook, the same way that I did for five years.

In this guide, I hope to talk about every single aspect of how to successfully become porn free. What you’ll need to learn. How you can learn those things. How not to fall into certain traps. The whole works.

Ultimately it comes down to a number of core skills and understandings that I have come to learn over the past five years in my NeverFap journey, and in each chapter I want to go into detail as to what these skills and understandings are, how I spent years doing it wrong, as well as how you can do it right.

Ahem.

These core skills exactly?

- Learning to focus on the how, not the why.
- Valuing the time spent improving my mental health above all.
- Developing the ability to quiet and focus my mind.
- Learning to love and accept myself and others unconditionally.
- Coming out about your addiction.
- Learning to invest in myself.
- Changing the way I think about sex and women.
- The value of commitment and long-term thinking.
- Identifying and understanding my various mental disorders.
- Properly understanding what life without porn is.

In each chapter I will explore each of these aspects in detail, as well as why they are so crucial for in regards to successfully overcoming porn addiction.

Of course, you don’t necessarily need to do all these things. However let me tell you, without most of these skills and learnings, you won’t be able to do it comfortably, nor necessarily with any amount of certainty. And without certainty, you may end up developing an unhealthy relationship with inherently healthy processes, just like I did.

And in order to do this, I’m going to dare to be transparent. I want to talk about my story from my point of view, and from there you can decide whether you think it’s something that will work for you.

Because ultimately, we’re all different people with different experiences in life, and my experiences may not reflect yours.

That’s okay too. This is just one of many resources and perspectives, and I dearly hope it can be of value to you.

The good news is that it’s doable and that as long as you follow every single step within this guide, and take the time to practice the skills you’re weakest at, then you can learn to comfortably become porn free. The bad news is that you’re also an addict, and you’ll probably end up spending more time fighting yourself, rather than committing to your recovery.

It took me around 5 years of trial and error before everything finally clicked in my head, and now I’m at a it has no control over me. Realistically, you could probably achieve the same thing in a few short months, but I also maintain that humans simply aren’t like that. Some of us are driven by failure and by experiencing things first-hand, and that’s okay too.

You are human. You are vulnerable. We all are.

I hope in reading this website that you discover a fundamental theme in all my posts: Overcoming porn addiction should be simple and effortless.

I didn’t up successfully give up pornography by fighting my emotions and cravings. It was only once I was able to detach myself from what I was feeling, that I was able to break through and commit to a life without porn.

Essentially, the moral of the story, is that If you’re really struggling with giving up porn, then there’s some aspect of your personality that you’re not yet familiar with. And it’s not until you fully understand who you are, that you can build up the confidence to commit to your goals. That’s what we’re here to discover.

So sit back. 

Relax. Laugh. Cry. 

We’re not here to fight ourselves any longer. 

We’re here to understand who we are, what we have to do to change, as well as how we can improve as people.
