This is a great exercise to do, which is designed to help dissolve our ego. 

In fact, all awareness exercises are designed to help dissolve our ego to some extent, however this one does it particularly well for reasons I'll outline below. 

<hr />

## Context

<hr />

Much like the <a class="link" href="/guide/slow-it-down">Slow it down</a> exercise, Dissolve it down is about manipulating our perception of reality, in order to exercise control over what our mind thinks and perceive. 

When you come to think about it, learning to define and describe reality is an essential part of what it means to be human.

It's what helps us gauge social situations, learn new theoretical concepts and better understand the world around us.

And yet although we live in this predefined world of assumptions based on what we understand, none of it is actually real.

These are just rules that we have come to appreciate over time, which although serve a wonderful purpose, also distorts how we understand reality. 

Take what you see in your visual field for example.

Instinctively we create visual depth. We identify objects. We identify how far away they are. We identify those objects which are living. We identify dangers, and so forth.

<hr />

### The takeaway is that with all this additional mental processing, are we even seeing reality?

<hr />

Is it possible to truly 'see' when our minds are consisently processing our visual field with a particular bias in mind?

What this exercise attempts to do is remove this bias from our visual understanding of reality. 

Not only to see a 'clearer' picture of reality, but to learn to understand what we're experiencing from a different point of view.

And perhaps there is no better way to dissolve your ego than to completely dissolve everything it's used to seeing. 

<hr />

## Exercise

<hr />

For this exercise, what we want to do is attempt to treat our visual field as a simple plane of a light and colour. 

No objects. No descriptions. No focusing on certain details over another.

Instead, treat what you see as just a non-descript arrangement of light and colour.

Another way of thinking of it is of having 'wide awareness' of what you see. Our aim isn't to focus, but rather to just relax and see what happens when you stop this visual processing. 

While you can do this anywhere, I personally find it works best when I have a good few minutes alone, where I can really explore this idea uninterupted.

For extra pointers, try and understand where you're experiencing this visual field from. Is it from your mind? Does your mind even exist if it is not processing?

All concepts which we will explore in future once we've mastered simpler exercises such as these.
