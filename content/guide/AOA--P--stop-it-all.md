I love this exercise.

I can't quite tell if this exercise is an analogue to <a class="link" href="/guide/slow-it-down">Slow it down</a> or a percursor to it.

However, I would like to say that this is arguably the easier of the two, but still, they're both before and unique skills within themselves.

## Context

<hr />

All awareness exercises essentially come down to finding different ways to break our perception of who we are.

This is important because our perception of who we are, isn't actually who we are.

It is merely an identity we carry to help us navigate through life.

And when we don't realise this, or aren't aware of it consciousness, then we can become ransom to this persona.

By learning to control this identity, we provide ourselves with the opportunity to be able to effectively control how we feel about ourselves.

Of course, if this is all new to you, then you're going to have start out small and develop the ability through time and practice.

And I must say, this is a really good one to start out with.

Essentially what it teaches you is to learn to let go.

So a key focus here is to put your attention into how you feel both mentally and physically when you do this activity.

## Exercise

<hr />

Essentially the idea behind this exercise is to turn off your mind completely. 

As if you were a robot that just had it's power supply cut off, shut down your thoughts, feelings and emotions. 

Make them disappear.

Empty your mind. Literally let it all go.

And see how that makes you feel and how that changes the way you perceive reality.
