So, you're convinced that porn is a bad thing and that you want to kick the habit for good?

Excellent, well, that's good news!

At this point, you've probably already attempted to give up porn in some capacity. You've probably tried, and failed, and you're seeking help to better understand how to make the process a lot easier. 

The first thing I would like to say is to not lose hope, and to forget about previous experiences. 

Ultimately, there are five principles which make NeverFap successful. Without all five, you will inevitably suffer. 



## You have choice over your mind


## You must choose balance over reward


## Respect yourself

## 

- Balance
- Meditation
