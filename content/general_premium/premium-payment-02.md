Ultimately, there are two ways that you can pay for the resources on this website, and our <a class="link" href="/donations">Donations</a> page also helps shed some light into this. 

The first way is by signing up for one of our tiers on Patreon. Each tier provides different benefits, as I'll explain in the next section below. 

Patreon is essentially a subscription service, so you pay an allotted amount per month for access to whatever resources that tier allows. Largely, it also helps fund NeverFap Deluxe as well, not to mention support a good cause.

The second way you can access these resources is by paying a once-off payment via Paypal (or credit card) for each ebook/course/email campaign you want.

This can be accessed in the backend of the website once you sign up for an account. You simply go to the thing you want to buy, pay for it, and it's yours forever. 

Certainly for most people, this can be the more sensisble option, especially if you simply want one thing and you don't feel like you need the rest. 

At the same time, you also lose a lot of the benefits of Patreon - so it really depends on what you think is right for you.
