Welcome to the Helpful NeverFap Counsel!

Essentially the Helpful NeverFap Counsel is an extension of our <a class="link" href="<%= Application.get_env(:nfd, :social_discord_url) %>">#accountability</a> program on Discord.

It's a volunteer program to help others with porn addiction, by providing others with the advice in regards to the NeverFap Deluxe Method of overcoming porn addiction.
