Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to focus on the cloud of sensation that is your own conscious experience.

So for this exercise I want you to bring yourself to a relaxed state.

Preferably sitting in a comfortable position.

And for this exercise I want you to leave your eyes open, so you can remain as aware as possible.

Essentially, what I want you to do, is to observe all things which your body is currently sensing.

In other words, I want you to observe the cloud of sensation you are currently experiencing.

You may want to observe the light that is currently making contact with your eyes.

You may want to observe the sensations you are currently feeling on your skin.

Perhaps, you may even want to focus your attention on the temperature of your body.

How you observe yourself is entirely up to you.


There is nothing to question. Nothing to think about.

All we are doing is observing what our body is currently sensing.



If you are having difficulty observing your senses, then it most likely means you are instead preoccupied with thinking.

An important thing to note about sensing, is that it's completely seperate from the process of thinking.

When you are thinking, it means you're not engaged with your senses.

Which is to say that it is impossible to effectively think and sense at the same time.

Of course, our focus for this exercise is to develop our skill of observation.

Because it is a skill many of us have not spent time developing.

Especially if you are the kind of person who tends to over-think and has difficulty remaining calm and focused.

So let's focus our attention back to our senses.

Remaining calm.

Without thought.

Without expectation.

And I’ll let you do this on your own for a period of time.


If you find your mind wandering off during this exercise, then just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

Observing what your body is feeling and sensing.

Observing the calmness you feel.

Observing the sensations interacting with you.


If you find your mind wandering off again, that’s okay. Just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

And continue to truly notice what your body is sensing.


And that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been. The neverfap Deluxe Guided meditation series.
