<!-- Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today I will be guiding you through the wonderful world of awareness and meditation.

If you're new to meditation, as always, the first step is to relax. To get yourself into a comfortable position, preferrably sitting if you're new to this. It's not recommended that you lie down for these exercises.

Certainly, your posture is important as well, because your posture helps you better focus and remain in a state of being calm, while also being alert. And, remaining alert is such an important part of meditation, since the goal of meditation itself is to help us develop our awareness. 

And it can be incredibly difficult to develop that awareness, if you're slouched, or tense or not present with your mind.

Awareness of course is important, so that we can become more mindful of our own thoughts and behaviours. Which as a result, can afford you greater control over those aspects of your life. Which can help us deal with mental illness, as well as a variety of different things such as anxiety and depression. 

In today's session we're going to keep the focus simple. Because ultimately, that's what effective awareness is about. It's about keeping your mind simple, relaxed and focused.

Essentially for this exercise, what we're going to do is pay attention to our senses.

By senses, I mean a number of things. For example, what your eyes are currently seeing. 

What your ears are hearing. Perhaps, there's a bird outside, chirping away or maybe you can hear the sound of a car driving by. It could even be the temperature of the air around and how that feels on your skin.

These are all sensations that we can pay attention to and focus on. And there truly are, any number of different ways we can sense the world around us.

Certainly, with this exercise we're not attempting to create anything or necessarily even feel anything in particular.

We're merely attempting to observe what we're feeling and what we're currently experiencing from our senses.

Personally, I find it helps to refer to all of these feelings as a cloud of sensation.

Because when you think about it, we only have one consciousness to perceive all these sensations with.

And so by observing all these sensations or even one of these sensations, what we're effective observing is our own single conscious awareness.

So, with this in mind... what is currently taking place within your own conscious awareness?

What are you currently feeling within the cloud of sensation that is your own conscious experience?

It could be physical calmness. It could be, the sound of relative silence which you're observing. Perhaps it's really hot, or really cold where you currently are. What is the sensation, for example, of the clothes on your body. Maybe it's something you don't even notice. That's absolutely fine as well.

Which is to say that there really is no right or wrong way to observe your own senses.

There's merely our own conscious awareness and what we're currently perceiving within it.

So I want you to really focus on that cloud of sensation. And I'll give you some space to really explore what it is you're currently sensing.



If you find yourself getting distracted and thinking about other things aside from what you're currently sensing.

It may help to just focus on a single sense. Like your hearing.



If you're getting distracted, remember to gently think about that cloud of sensation.

What you're feeling from it. 


Well, that brings us to the end of today's session. If you enjoyed this meditation, feel free to checkout the website www.neverfapdeluxe.com. We have a variety of articles, practices, even a fortnightly podcast for those who are interested. Not to mention, I also have a Patreon for those interested in supporting these meditations financially.

Regardless, I hope you have a wonderful rest of the day. 

Stay safe. Stay calm and don't forget to relax.  -->
