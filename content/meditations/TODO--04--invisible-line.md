Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to try something a bit more conceptual than you may be used to.

So for this exercise I want you to get relaxed, preferably sitting in a comfortable position, and I want you to leave your eyes open for this exercise.

Essentially, what I want you to do is imagine an invisible line.

And, I want you to focus your attention on this invisible line.

I want you to focus your attention on this line, and become conscious of it's presence.

Which is to say that we want to observe it's presence, and take note of the fact that it's there.


Much like other exercises where we have you observing your senses, in this exercise what we're doing is observing a self-created construct within our minds.

Which we therefore can sense.


There’s nothing to question. Nothing to think about. All we’re doing is observing what is in front of us.



So with that said, simply observe what’s in front of you.

Without thought.

Without expectation.

And I’ll let you do this for a few minutes.


If you find your mind wandering off during this exercise, then just gently remind yourself to continue observing.



Calm.

Relaxed.

Essentially, in observation.




If you find your mind wandering off again, that’s okay. Just gently remind yourself to continue observing.


And that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been. The neverfap Deluxe Guided meditation series.








<!--
Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today I will be guiding you through the wonderful world of awareness and meditation.

Before we begin, I'd like to thank you today for choosing me to guide you and teach you new things about yourself. I hope you can find value in these words, and use them to better understand who you are as a human being.

Certainly, the first thing I encourage you to do for all these exercises is to relax. Find yourself a comfortable spot in a relatively quiet location, where you can sit comfortably, preferably with a straight back, in order to practice today's meditation.

Putting yourself into a relaxed state is always the first step towards self-discovery.

It can incredibly hard to try and discover peace when your mind is all over the place, and this really applies to any you do in life - whether it be meditation or perhaps study for an intense exam.

Without being calm and relaxed, it can become incredibly difficult to be truly aware and in-control of ourselves.

For today's meditation I want you to close your eyes.

Of course, remaining relaxed.

...and I want you to imagine as if there's an invisible imaginary line that is currently parrallel to your spine.

It can be a simple straight line. It may even be a curved line that forms around your spine. Essentially, it can be anything you want it to be.

But as long as it's a line in some form.

And, I want you to focus your attention on this invisible line.

I want you to focus on this line, and become conscious of it's presence.

Which is to say that we want to observe it's presence, and take note of the fact that it's there.


Much like other exercises where we have you observing your senses, in this exercise what we're doing is observing a self-created construct within our minds.

Which we therefore can sense.



If you find yourself getting distracted, with thoughts perhaps, just gently place your attention back on this invisible line.

Remember to feel it's presence.

Is it heavy, for example? Does this line radiant anything? Does it have a particular colour?

All things to observe and sense.



Remember to keep your attention on this line.


Certainly, what does it mean to pay attention and to observe something? Is it a reflection of the thing that is being observed, or the observer itself?
