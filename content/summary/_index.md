Here's a basic summary of NeverFap Deluxe!

In essence, there are Healthy Coping Mechanisms and there are Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms.

Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms include things like watching porn and being judgemental/self-critical, while Healthy Coping Mechanisms include things like remaining calm and practicing meditation.

Now, in order to overcome your porn addiction there is one sole thing you need to do.


{{< hr3 "Develop control over your mind so you can dictate every single aspect of how you think, feel and behave." >}}


It is a reasonable goal which absolutely everyone is capable of.

It can help to think of addicts like children with learning difficulties. There is nothing inherently wrong with you, you just haven't been taught how to think constructively in a way that makes sense to you, for a very long time.

Healthy Coping Mechanisms are important because they are sole means through which you will develop control over your mind.

And anything which doesn't doesn't help you with that goal can be considered an Unhealthy Coping Mechanism, whether it be edging, over-rationalising, asking counter-produtive questions etc.

So what does it mean to have developed control over your mind?

Essentially, it means being able to consciously direct your mind however you like, rather than have your subconscious behaviours and you desires control you.

Which really is a key point to understand.


{{< hr3 "A lot of our Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms are merely learnt behaviours and responses, which can be replaced and relearnt with Healthy Coping Mechanisms instead." >}}

Essentially, what control provides you with at the end of the day is balance, and there are three broad categories of Healthy Coping Mechanisms which contribute towards this balance.

Awareness, Calmness and Ambition.

If you have all three of these areas in your life under control then you will be in balance and you won't struggle with urges or doubt or the common effects of Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms.

Most addicts however struggle with at least one or two of these categories, and those areas will be the key focus of your recovery.

As a principle, the way you develop these Healthy Coping Mechanisms is through practice and consistency. They are the only things which matter to your recovery from a process point of view.

And the easiest way to develop both Calmness and Awareness is through meditation.

For most people, it essentially comes down to meditating 10 minutes each day, and that will be enough to help them develop control over their minds.

It's personally what I do everyday, and it's what helps me maintain balance. 

...aaaaand that is NeverFap Deluxe in a nutshell.

Meditation is key.
