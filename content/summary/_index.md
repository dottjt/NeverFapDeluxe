Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Summary.

Ultimately porn addiction recovery comes down to one thing: 


{{< hr3 "Replacing Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms with Healthy Coping Mechanisms." >}}


Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms include things like watching porn and being judgemental/self-critical, while Healthy Coping Mechanisms include things like remaining calm and practicing meditation.

There is no alternative to this process.

There are no "cheap hacks" to suddenly make you stop being addicted to porn, where you somehow magically have this moment of awareness where everything just dissolves away and your life returns to normal.

(although yes, it 110% can be normal again, it just won't happen without putting in hard work)

Instead, it's a hard process of learning to replace negative habits with positive ones, and that's really all there is to it. 

Now, the reason why you've been struggling is most likely because you've been going about this process in an unproductive way. 

For example, you may have been attempting to distract yourself (watching youtube videos, going for a run, cold showers etc.) as a way to address your uncomfortable feelings and emotions.

{{< hr3 "When what you should have been doing is learning to consciously relax and be present with your feelings and emotions in a healthy and meaningful way." >}}

What a lot of people don't realise is that distraction is in fact one of the many Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms people practice everyday without realising it.

And this is why education and awareness play such an important part of the process, so we can truly understand the effect of our behaviours and actions on a daily basis. 

In fact, chances are that you may have never meaningfully attempted to replace those unhealthy coping mechanisms, but instead, hoped they would somehow wither away on their own.

Unfortunately that isn't how life works, and this attitude is one of the primary reasons why people remain addicted to porn so unnecessarily for so long.

Only by consciously addressing our issues can we hope to achieve meaningful change.

Now, the reason why Healthy Coping Mechanisms work is quite simple:


{{< hr3 "Healthy Coping Mechanisms help you develop control over your mind so you can dictate every single aspect of how you think, feel and behave." >}}


To come back to our previous example, distraction is an Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms because it doesn't help us develop control over our minds. 

Instead, it does the exact opposite to that. It merely puts our emotions and feelings aside, without truly addressing them in a conscious nor meaningful way.

Furthermore, learning to develop control over our minds is a completely reasonable goal which everyone is capable of.

From the perspective of your porn addiction, it can help to think of your self-destructive behaviours as a learning difficulty. 

Which is to say that there's nothing inherently wrong with you. You just haven't been taught how to think and feel in constructive way that makes sense to you, for a very long time.

Well, Healthy Coping Mechanisms are going to be the sole means through which you will learn to develop that control over your mind.

Put simply, because there are no other sustainable alternatives. 

For example, you'd be hard pressed to convince me that binging on junk food to deal with your emotions is ever going to be sustainable, as opposed to something like meditation which doesn't affect your physical health negatively.

Furthermore, anything which doesn't help you with this goal of adopting Healthy Coping Mechanisms can be considered an Unhealthy Coping Mechanism, whether it be doubting the process, over-rationalising etc.

So what does it mean to have developed control over your mind?


{{< hr3 "Essentially, it means being able to consciously direct your mind however you like, rather than have your subconscious behaviours and you desires control you." >}}


Which really is key to understanding why you may have been struggling with your porn addiction for so long.

A lot of our Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms are merely learnt behaviours and responses, which can be replaced and relearnt with Healthy Coping Mechanisms instead.

In summary, what having control provides you with at the end of the day is balance, and there are three broad categories of Healthy Coping Mechanisms which contribute towards this balance.

Awareness, Calmness and Ambition.

If you have all three of these areas in your life under control then you will be in balance and you won't struggle with urges or doubt or the common side-effects of Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms.

Most addicts however struggle with at least one or two of these categories, and those areas will be the key focus of your recovery.

Now, the way you develop these Healthy Coping Mechanisms is through practice and consistency. They are the only things which matter to your recovery from a process point of view.

And the easiest way to develop both Calmness and Awareness is through meditation.

For most people, it essentially comes down to meditating 10 minutes each day, and that will be enough to help them develop control over their minds.

It's personally what I do everyday, and it's what helps me maintain balance. 

Of course, you may struggle primarily with Ambition as well. I don't know you well enough to say for certain, although I'm happy to provide you with personalised advice via our <a class="link" href="https://neverfapdeluxe.com/new-fap-deluxe-reddit-guidelines">#NewNeverFapper</a> initiative.

...aaaaand that is NeverFap Deluxe in a nutshell.

Ultimately, meditation is key.
