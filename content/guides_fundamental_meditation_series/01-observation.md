## Understanding observation

Hello, and welcome to Part 1 of the NeverFap Deluxe Fundamental Meditation Series. In today’s session we’re going to be focusing on this idea of observation.

And the reason why we’re doing this, is because observation is the most important skill you can learn in regards to practicing meditation.


### Meditation is observation

In fact, and a lot of people don't realise this, however meditation is literally nothing more than a form of observation. 

Which is to say that effective observation forms the basis of effective meditation. And when you understand this, meditation becomes incredibly simple to both practice and reason with.

Here’s the deal: Meditation should be effortless. Which is to say that it should not in any way be a challenge. If you feel bored during your meditations, or if you feel as if you're constantly fighting your mind or finding yourself getting distracted by thoughts or judgements, then it means you're not meditating correctly.


### Why we struggle with meditation - part 1

Now there's generally two reasons why people struggle to meditate:

The first reason is because people don't realise that effective meditation is nothing more than a form of observation, and instead they fundamental misunderstand meditation what meditation is.

For example, a lot of people think that it’s about having an intense focus or really trying to concentrate, but none of those things are meditation, which is why people struggle with it so much. 

Because they fundamentally misunderstand what meditation is, which is a form of observation. Focus and observation are two very different things, and although focus can be a by-product of meditation - focus itself is not the process of meditation.


### Why we struggle with meditation - part 1

The other reason, which is largely an inverse of the first reason is because most people simply don't know how to observe. 

Which may sound odd, but it's the same reason why some people end up developing highly self-critical or overly judgemental personalities. 

It's because society doesn't teach us to observe. Instead, it largely teaches us to think and when all you know is thinking, then inherently you're going to try and think your way out of your problems, which of course doesn't work, which leads to rumination and all sorts of mental health problems.

So when you tell someone "I want you to observe your surroundings" inherently their first reaction is to think. So they struggle with the very idea of observation, and 

Not to mention internally on some level they also think, "But wait, observation is not a form of thinking, therefore why am I even bothering with it?" and it's this line of thinking most people also avoid meditation altogether.

Because it doesn't fit within their model of understanding, which is the same model which also underpins their mental health issues. 

On the other hand, if you treat meditation as a form of observation, it makes it really easy to practice.

And like I've said, meditation should be effortless. If it's not effortless, then it's not effective meditation.


### What is observation?

So what exactly is observation?

Well, observation is literally nothing more than paying attention to your surroundings.

Again, it is inherently simple and for whatever reason, people assume that simple answers must be nosense. It really doesn't make any sense, but that's just how a lot of humans think.

So what I want you to do, assuming you're in a position to spend a few minutes to practice some mental health exercises, is to simply notice what's in front of you.


### Practicing basic observation

And what do you see? 

What's interesting is that although we are constantly seeing, that isn't to say that we are always noticing or paying attention to what's in front of us.

Again, in a lot of cases we're either absent minded or we're engaged in thinking. Generally, we're not observing, because in the model of constant thinking and judging - not thinking is seen as something unproductive or even pointless.

What I'm asking you right now in this very moment, is to instead engage in observation. 

And simply notice what's in front of you.

And I want you to notice the clarity that you feel. The effortless clarity that simply comes from observing the vision in front of you.

And one thing you'll notice is that observation itself does not require thought.

Observation is largely a thoughtless activity and this brings us to why observation forms the common backbone of effective meditation.

It's because effective meditation is also inherently thoughtless.


### Goals are not the process

You see, here's where most people go wrong with meditation.

Most people focus on the goals of meditation - which is increased focus, increased calmness, being more present with oneself, and all those kinds of things.

Now in overall scheme of things, those things are important. Correct. However, what you need to understand is that these things are merely the by-products of effective meditation.

Which is to say that they are not meditation itself, they are merely the outcomes of practicing effective meditation. They are not the process.

Instead, observation is the process, and observation is the action we should be focusing our attention and efforts on, because that is what effective meditation is. 

Only by mastering observation can we hope to maintain the outcomes of meditation.


### What do we observe?

Now that you understand the significance and the role of observation in regards to effective meditation, we're going to dive a bit deeper into what it really is. 

So like before, I want you to continue taking notice of what's in front of you. 

Observing, without thought or without expectation, that which you see with your eyes. 

There's nothing in particular for you to notice or point out.

Now there's a few other things going on right now, in regards to the dynamics of 



Observation makes meditation effortless.




Essentially, observation forms the basis of all meditation, and the sad thing is that a lot of people don’t know this. 

And because most people don’t know this, it’s part of the reason why people struggle so much with meditation.
