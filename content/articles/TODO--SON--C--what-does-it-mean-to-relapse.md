I get this question a lot.

Often people will come to me asking if producing pre-cum, edging or experiencing a wet dream constitutes as relapse.

And it's a question which always produces the same two counter questions:


{{< hr3 "What is your definition of relapse and how does that help you develop Healthy Coping Mechanisms?" >}}


At the end of the day, I don't care what your definition of relapse is, because it has nothing to do with developing Healthy Coping Mechanisms.

In fact, even thinking about this question is an Unhealthy Coping Mechanism because it's just a distraction from focusing on meaningful change.

Far too often, people end up worrying about these small details which don't particular matter when it comes to improving our mental health or developing capacity for awareness.

Which is to say that focusing on this question of "What is relapse?" is one of the most helplessly pointless things you can spend your time doing.

And yet people will spend hours obsessing over it, as if it's actually going to help them in some meaningful way.

Regardless, if you want a very concrete definition of what I personally think relapse is within the context of NeverFap Deluxe.


{{< hr3 "Relapse is anything which doesn't help you develop control over your mind." >}}


I don't care if it's edging. Googling safe images of women. Slightly touching your appendage. Hell, even hesitating to make a simple decision such as what you're going to wear for that day, or doubting yourself momentarily.

Anything which hinders or contradicts your ability to develop control over your feelings and emotions, is what I would define as relapse.

Of course, I think the reason why relapse becomes this huge concern is because of this idea of your "PMO streak" whereby you count the days since your last "relapse".

And I can't even begin to tell you how much I hate this philosophy.

It's possibly one of the worst inventions to have ever been conceived in regards to any kind of addiction recovery, which is one of the primary reasons why so many pepole are struggling so hard with their recovery.

And yet people swear by it, in part because it's what they see others do and so it's created this knock-on effect of bad practice.

So people have these "streaks" which therefore means they need to define some measure of relapse, in order to keep themselves "accountable".

And so what they do is they have to come up with a set of guidelines in order to justify this regime, which is like trusting someone with a gambling problem to write up a

Inevitably what happens is that we willingly change these guidelines to suit our own agenda which inevitably leads to situations such as:

"Well, is it relapse if I watch porn and masturbate for hours, but don't end up orgasming?"

Like, cmon. Is this really the kind of playing field that we want to promote?

Ultimately, the reason why this whole concept of relapse is ineffective, is because it's an inverse take on the actual process itself.

Rather than creating a dialogue around the Healthy Coping Mechanisms we should be practicing and how they can apply to our own lives, we instead focus on the opposite which is behaviours which we should avoid.

Which is a really indirect way of trying to achieve the same thing, without actaully taking about

I think that's in effect why NoFap and in particular r/NoFap has gone down the drain, because people are instead so insistent about talking about what they shouldn't do, that everyone has no idea what to actually do.

Addiction recovery is not a game of exclusion. It's a game of active participation and change.

Change which can only come from practice and consistency in all areas of our life.
