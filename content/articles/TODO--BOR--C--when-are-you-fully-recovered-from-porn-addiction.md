Well, the funny thing is that there actually is a very comprehensive way to know whether you're fully recovered or not.

Put simply, you are fully recovered once you have full confidence in your ability to overcome your porn addiction.

Which is to say that if you are 100% certain that you know absolutely everything you need to know in order to overcome your porn addiction.

Then there's no reason for you to ever relapse again. 

On the other hand, if you have even the slightest doubt about any possible situation which you believe may unravel you, then you are not recovered.

Because from that moment, I knew I had all the skills necessary in order to be able to deal with whatever emotions and feelings life threw at me. 

And I've proven myself correct ever since. 

In essence, although overcoming porn addiction may seem like a game of confidence, this is merely a symptom of the real cause which is skill.

When you have a high degree of skill, because you've been practicing meditation and awareness execrices everyday, it provides you with the confidence to be able to approach your porn addiction recovery with absolute certainty.
