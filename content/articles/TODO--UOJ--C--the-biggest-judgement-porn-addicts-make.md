Most porn addicts struggle with judgement, whether judging others or feeling judged themselves.

Certainly, it's part of the reason why we fall into the cycle of watching porn, immediately criticising ourselves for our actions, which then makes us feel worse about ourselves, which then propells us to continue watching porn and masturbating in order to feel better.

It's a cycle I'm sure you're more-than familiar with, just as I once was.

This response of self-criticism is one which often runs deep into how we think, as a habit that most people have developed since childhood.

A habit which has become so prominent in our lives, that we simply don't even realise we're doing it most of the time.

When we make a judgement it can happen so quickly and so automatically, that we may even see it as something normal, rather than something harmful that needs to be addressed.

Especially, if it's a judgement directed at ourselves.

Whether through habits we developed from our parents or perhaps learnt via our own means, judging ourselves is arguably one of the most harmful things we do as human beings.

It's the reason why we find ourselves stuck in cycles of addiction, as well as feel terrible, often for no reason at all.

Essentially, many of us have a habit of telling ourselves off whenever we feel as if we've done something wrong.

"I shouldn't have stared at that woman."

"I shouldn't be feeling this way."

"I can't believe I did that."

All trains of thought which lead to despair, hopelessness and

Of course, if being judgement is all you know, then inspite of how it makes you feel, it may also be familiar to you in the sense that it feels like a natural thing to do.

It is an aspect of your personality which you have developed, and likely reinforced every single day of your life.

Which is cool. I used to be like that too, but it's certainly not the only way to think about life.

The alternative on the other hand is not to judge, and instead to refrain from having an opinion.
