  tldr1: "The biggest judgement we make is when we tell ourselves off for doing something we feel we shouldn't have done."
  tldr2: "There is no right or wrong. There is merely your control and understanding of the situation."

There's a habit that most people have developed since childhood.

A habit which is so prominent in our lives, that in most cases we simply don't even realise we're doing it.

Which they remain completely oblivious to for the rest of their lives. 

In part because they don't recognise it as something harmful, and therefore as something that doesn't need to be addressed. 

Although this habit is effectively a judgement, the interesting thing is that people fail to recognise it as a judgement.

And it's probably for this reason alone, why it seems to slip under the radar, even for someone like myself.

The alternative on the other hand is not to have that emotional reaction.
