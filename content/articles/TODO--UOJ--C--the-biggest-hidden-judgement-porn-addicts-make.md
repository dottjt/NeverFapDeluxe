  tldr1: "The biggest hidden judgement we make is when we tell ourselves off for doing something we feel we shouldn't."

There's a habit that most people have.

Which they remain completely oblivious to for the rest of their lives. 

In part because they don't recognise it as something harmful, and therefore as something that doesn't need to be addressed. 

Although this habit is effectively a judgement, the interesting thing is that people fail to recognise it as a judgement.

And it's probably for this reason alone, why it seems to slip under the radar, even for someone like myself.

The alternative on the other hand is not to have that emotional react.





"I shouldn't have stared at that woman."

"I shouldn't be feeling the way I feel."
