This article aims to explore the idea of what it means to have the mindset of someone who does NeverFap.

The thing I love most about NeverFap is that it's designed to make addressing your porn addiction easy.

It's about learning to co-exist with your emotions, so that you don't even get to a point of even having porn cravings.

That's my definition of effortless, and believe that successful porn recovery requires effortlessness in order for it to be effective.

If I had to use one word to describe how NeverFap changes you, I would use the word:


{{< hr3 "Calm." >}}


It's not about being excited, determined or ready to dominate the world with your new-found energy.

It's about being calm. 

When you practice the NeverFap Deluxe exercises everyday and apply them to your life, you feel calm and collected. 

You feel incontrol of your emotions and more importantly, you don't fear the unknown because you have a strategy in place and you know exactly what to expect.

Part of the reason why being calm and collected is so important, is because it becomes really hard to self-harm when you're feeling calm.

It's hard to be judgemental or have an emotional reaction when we're calm. 

It's hard to take our emotions personally when we're calm, centered and aware of ourselves in the moment. 


{{< hr3 "And what makes it so wonderful is that being calm doesn't require any effort." >}}


In the sense that calmness is within itself, a lack of effort.

Ultimately, it's only possible to be tense if you're actively doing something to disrupt being calm.

Calmness is what happens when you let go of all your thoughts and simply just be. 

It's what your brain was like as a child, before you developed the obsessive thinking and learned to accept being tense as something normal.

Of course, chances are that you may struggle with being calm, because that's simply not how you've trained your brain to think and respond.

That's okay too.


{{< hr3 "It's simply a matter of following your daily routine of NeverFap Deluxe Practices." >}}


By commiting to meditation and practices which teach you self-control over your mind, you're essentially guaranteed to change how you think and feel.

Honestly, it's that simple. 

Do the practices. Reap the rewards.




Often, our level of calmness is any single situation is usually a good indicator of our mental health at the time. 

If we're feeling tense and stressed, then it's likely that we're reacting or experiencing judgement in some way, shape or form.
