For a number of people suffering from mental health issues, balance is often seen as a weakness. 

After all, it's part of the reason why they ended up mentally ill in the first place, and certainly it's a point of view I can personally relate to from my own experiences with mental illness.

Well, I'm here to tell you otherwise.

With balance comes an absurd amount of benefits, and that is something I would like to share with you today.

For starters, a lot of people assume balance is snonymous with being 'normal' or 'boring'. As if we're attempting to maintain some sort of insufferably average life devoid of any pain or pleasure. 

While this is may be true in some cases for some people, this kind of thinking doesn't truly capture the essence of what balance is about.

Instead, balance can merely be thought as a counter-balance to our more destructive side. 

Balance isn't telling you not to go absolutely wild, and live your life in the face of fear. 


{{< hr3 "It's telling you to go crazy, but then meditate for 10 minutes after in order to calm down." >}}


It's the yin and yang of balance that people often forget, which is so vital to ensuring that we're effective.

And it lends itself to a wide range of different fears some people maintain towards adopting mental health best practice in their lives.

Also known as having self-limiting beliefs.

One common self-limiting belief people have, is that by adopting balance and proper mental health practice into our lives, that it's going to result in inherently losing part of ourselves. 


{{< hr3 "Most often, the fun quirkiness that is our personality." >}}


Yet this simply isn't the case. The great thing about balance is that it allows you to have your cake and eat it too. 

Again, balance isn't necessarily about removing the craziness from your life. It's about providing you with the insurance in order to ensure that you can keep on top of it all.

And not get caught up in the depression and anxiety that usually results from an unbalanced mind. 

Ultimately, balance should be viewed as an opportunity to experience something more.

To experience the effectiveness of not only being in control over your mind, but also be comfortable with your feelings and emotions, even if they may be a bit wild.


{{< hr3 "Of course, an important thing to keep in mind is that it's also a very different way of thinking for most." >}}


A way of thinking which a lot of people find limiting, because they're now holding themselves accountable for their actions.

Which can be quite scary a lot of people, simply due to the denial of realising that they even have a problem in the first place, which previously they had been putting aside and ignoring. 

Yet the funny thing is that we always were accountable for our actions irrespective of whether we respected those boundaries or not.

It's the very reason why we feel intense sadness or depression, precisely because we have broken those boundaries and are now experiencing the effect of our actions.

Instead, it merely reinforces these negative behaviours and emotions and leaves us even more confused and hopeless when we do eventually experience them.

Only by maintaining balance can we ensure that we not only keep on top of these negative habits, but also learn to remain calm while doing so.
