I want to talk about choice.

Specifically, how it relates to one of our Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap: Choice over mind.

<hr />

### What Choice over mind relates to is this idea that we have the ability to choose how we react to our circumstances. 

<hr />

To break this down even further: 

Firstly, it conveys this idea that everything in life is a choice.

Choice in how we feel. Choice in what we want to think. Choice in how we live and what we want to eat.

And yet, just because choice exists, doesn't necessarily mean that we get to choose nor that there may be many choices for us to begin with.

Now some people would say that the fact that we don't get to choose everything in life, if not most the things in our life, means that we do not have choice. 

We don't have choice over our genetic makeup. We don't have choice over how others act and treat us. We don't have choice over what the weather will be.

Some might even say, that we are victims to the world around us. 

I'm here to convince you otherwise.

<hr />

### You see, you have one very important choice you can make.

<hr />

And it's so powerful, it effective overrides every other choice that you've made, or have had made for you. 


You can choose how you want to respond.

And I really cannot emphasise how powerful this choice really is, because in effect, it is the only choice you as an individual actually have in life. 

<hr />

## The Victim Mindset

<hr />

When you truly understand what Choice over mind means, it complete changes the way you look at things. 

You no longer become victim, or rather you realise that you never were victim over the things you cannot choose.

And to top it off, it also makes you realise that those things you thought you couldn't choose, you absolutely could all along.

Because when you break out of the victim mindset, what happens is that you no longer start focusing on what you cannot change, but instead begin focusing on what you can become.

And when you realise that you can become anything you want, it changes the way you think about who and what you are. 

Instead of being obsessed with "I work out constantly and yet I don't have the genetics for a six pack" the narrative becomes something more along the lines of "I cannot believe how amazingly strong I've become."

Which is to say that the victim mindset is just a filter over what you see and perceive. 

With that said, what exactly can we choose?

<hr />

- We can choose what we want to think, and whether we want to think at all. 
- We can choose what we want to believe, and whether we want to believe at all. 
- We can choose how we want to feel, and whether we want to feel at all.

<hr />

As you can tell, the overwhelming theme is that we have control over our mind.

And when you realise that your mind consists of almost everything relating to your human existence, you realise that you actually are fully in control of who you are, irrespective of all the other choices that you may have had made for you.

<hr />

## Making Choices

<hr />

The reason why I emphasise Choice over mind is because it's a principle which I can strongly relate to in my own life. 

I didn't really have it great growing up.

I didn't have a supportive family, let alone much of a family at all. 

I didn't really have a lot of friends, and I didn't really get to experience many of the things that a lot of people generally get to experience growing up. 

And sure, a lot of that was influenced by my own actions and mental health, but it simply was my human experience.

Which made me sad.

And yet when you realise that you don't have to 


Break ups are a perfect example.
