There are times when our emotions can become unmanagable. 

For example, we may be feeling intensely anxious about a date we have planned for that night or we may even be feeling trapped under the pressure from family or colleagues to perform well at school or in our jobs.

All situations which pique our urge to masturbate or watch porn, to a point where we can't help but feel as if we have no choice but to give in.

I'm sure you can relate, just as I once did.

Ultimately, when we lose control over our emotions, we lose control over our ability to act effectively and it's these situations where we can begin to spiral down the path of relapse and helplessness.

Not only in order to be effective with our emotions, however also because these situations are inevitably going to arise in the early stages of our recovery, and therefore shouldn't be used as an excuse or perceived barrier to our recovery.

For many of us, being unable to effectively manage our emotions forms part of the reason why we're still porn addicts. 

In fact, learning to be able to effectively manage our emotions, is usually the first hurdle most of us face when it comes to addressing our porn addiction.

We have a craving, we hesitate, we attempt to postpone it (usually unsuccessfully), and then we eventually give in.

It's where many of us are stuck mentally in terms of being able to effectively address our porn addiction.

Well, I'm here to help. 


{{< hr3 "I want to start by saying that it's actually a super simple process once you understand the dynamics of how we take things personally." >}}


The first thing to understand about taking things personally is that it's often a subconscious response.

Which is to say that it usually manifests itself as an instant emotional reaction, rather than as part of an informed decision we've made prior to the emotion reaction.

Otherwise we'd simply recognise that it isn't worth the effort, and we'd avoid wasting our energy maintaining those negative emotions.

Yet because we're not aware, nor conscious of how we should act, simply because we've never been taught otherwise, we end up doing the opposite to what we should do. 


{{< hr3 "What typically happens when we feel uncomfortable with our emotions, is we try to assume control over them." >}}


Mentally on some level, we think, "If I can force myself to react differently or counter those emotions on some level, I can not let them affect me."

In the case of anxiety or self-doubt, it usually leads to some form of talking ourselves up. "You can do it! There's no reason to feel sad at all!" 

We tell ourselves that we're smart, confident and in-control - even though deep-down inside, our feelings are telling us otherwise.

And so it ends up making us feel worse.


{{< hr3 "Instead, what we want to do is refrain entirely." >}}


And that is the simplest way we can not take our emotions personally is by refraining from interacting with them.

While this may seem like dumb, if not stupid advice, it is also correct approach in terms of learning to develop control over our minds.

The easiest way to deal with your emotions is to refrain from interacting with them.

Now, where a lot of confusion comes from is this idea of what "refraining" truly means. 

For example, some people misconstrue it for meaning "distraction". So in the case of being anxious, going and watching a calming YouTube video to cope.


{{< hr3 "Yet when you think about it, going and watching a calming YouTube video is actually a form of reaction." >}}


You've experienced anxiety, and so as a coping mechanism you've decided to do something about i.e. watch a video.

This directly contradicts this idea of refraining and what refraining truly means in the context of your mental health.

To refrain is to not react at all, which empowers you not to experience those feelings. 

It's a bit like saying, "Thank you, but no thank you." to your emotions. It's a form of acknowledgement, without giving them power over you.

Because when you react, you actually give that train of thought power. What you're saying mentally is "Yes, these feelings are valid and now I am going to address them".


{{< hr3 "Now, while we've covered a lot of theory in regards to refraining and how we take things personally, actually practicing this is a different story." >}}


Essentially, in order to refrain effectively, we need to develop our skills of conscious awareness, in order to catch the ways we react emotionally.

And the only way we can do this, is by practicing the awareness exercises on the NeverFap Deluxe website, as well as meditate daily - so we can have that capacity to see our actions more clearly.

Once you have developed that capacity for conscious awareness, then you'll have a much easier time refraining.
