There are times when our emotions can become unmanagable. 

For example, in moments when we feel anxious or when our urge to masturbate to porn becomes so strong that we can't help but feel as if we have no choice but to give in.

It's important that we learn not to take our emotions personally in these kinds of situations.

Because these situations are are inevitably going to arise in the early stages of our recovery.

For many of us, being unable to effectively manage our cravings forms part of the reason why we're still porn addicts. 

We have a craving, we hesitate, we attempt to postpone it (usually unsuccessfully), and then we eventually give in.

It's a cycle you've most likely been repeating your entire life up until now, and it may very well be where you're stuck at mentally in terms of being able to effectively address your porn addiction.

Well, I'm here to help.

Yet because we're simply not conscious of what we should do, simply because we've never been taught any differently, we end up doing the opposite to what we actually should. 

What typically happens when we feel uncomfortable with our emotions, is we try to assume control over them.

Mentally on some level, we think, "If I can force myself to react differently or counter those emotions on some level, I can not let them effectively."

In the case of anxiety or self-doubt, it usually leads to some form of talking ourselves up. 

We tell ourselves the opposite. That we're smart, confident and in-control - even though our feelings reflect the complete opposite of this.

And it only makes us feel worse. 

The reasons for this are numerous. 

For starters, you can't change something that isn't real or isn't there.

What we fail to understand is that the reason why we feel this way in the first place is because it's actually what we believe in that moment.
