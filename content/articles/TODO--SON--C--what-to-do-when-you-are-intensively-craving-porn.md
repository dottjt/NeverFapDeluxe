The response is always the same, regardless of whether you're intensely craving porn or not.

As the website says, calmness is a core tennant of the NeverFap Deluxe Method.

Which is to say that your job is to always relax. 

If you are always relaxed and in-touch with your emotions, then there is no possible way that you can experience cravings.

The reason why you experience cravings is because you've lost balance in some way, due to a failure to relax. 

A key thing to understand about cravings is that they don't just happen suddenly, as they may often feel like. 

In truth, the path towards developing those cravings were set many hours ago without you consciously realising it.

And that's why I place such a heavy emphasis on developing awareness, because it's one of the most effective methods we have in regards to preventing ourselves from losing balance.

For example, maybe you decided it would be okay to stay up to pursue your work or hobbies, only to find yourself in a situation where you're now tired and have no control over your emotions. 


{{< hr3 "Often it can be an incredibly small decision that you made hours ago, which can have serious knock on effects later down the track." >}}


Sometimes it's just a priority thing. Maybe you thought it would be okay to spend just ten minutes more playing video games, only to find yourself stressed out trying to catch up with all your chores. 

There are many different ways we can lose balance, much of it largely obvious to you.

Well, I'm asking you to take it a step further.

I'm asking you to actually act on this knowledge and stop yourselves from making these reckless decisions. 

Put simply, because there is no other alternative.

A key misunderstanding a lot of people have with awareness is that it somehow gives you "super powers".


{{< hr3 "Like, you practice your 10 minutes of meditation each day, and that suddenly makes you immune from everything." >}}


Absolutely incorrect.

Rather, awareness is merely a tool that is designed to help you make it easier for you to do the hard (but right) thing of consciously changing your mind. 

There is no "easy way" or "cheap hack" to overcome porn addiction.

At the end of the day, it still comes down to replacing Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms (such as watching porn)





You can have the most perfect two weeks of feeling as if you're completely invulnerable to the influence of porn.

Only to breakdown into a puddle of mud the moment your mind decides to do a complete 180 and taunt you with your cravings for it. 

In this article I hope to describe how we get to this point, and what we can actually do about it.


{{ hr4 "Like most things in life, there's good news and there's bad news." }}


The bad news is that once you've experienced an episode, there's very little you can do.

Especially if you haven't yet developed the skills to calm down and not take your emotions personally. 

The good news is that not only can we learn to not take our emotions personally.

But with proper practice, we can prevent ourselves from having cravings altogether.










The good news is that there's so much we can do so that we don't experience cravings at all. 







The root of the problem really comes down that "until it's not" part.
