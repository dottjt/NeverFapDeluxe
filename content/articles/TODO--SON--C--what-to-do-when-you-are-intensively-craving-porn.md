The response is always the same. Relax.

I'm sure you're no stranger to experiencing intense cravings.

You know, the kind of cravings where you know you've mentally given up from the very moment it hit you. 

And the worst thing is that these cravings can seem to appear out of nowhere.

You can have the most perfect two weeks of feeling as if you're completely invulnerable to the influence of porn.

The bad news is that once you've experienced an episode, there's very little you can do.

Especially if you haven't yet developed the skills to calm down and not take your emotions personally. 

The good news is that not only can we learn to not take our emotions personally.

The good news is that there's so much we can do so that we don't experience cravings at all. 







The root of the problem really comes down that "until it's not" part.
