“Why am I a porn addict?”

Attempting to gain an understand into why we are the way we are can be interesting. But to be quite honest, it’s a lot less relevant than figuring out how to change it. 

In fact, trying to understand why something is the way it is, is one of the biggest traps that porn addicts fall into. 

It’s like trying to figure out your life purpose by asking the question “Why do I exist?” 

Why you exist has no correlation to what purpose you have in life. You can have purpose for absolutely any reason imaginable, as you can be a porn addict for any number of reasons. 

Here's a tip:

<hr/>

### If you want to figure out your life purpose, just do a heap of things.

<hr/>

You don't figure out what you want in life by thinking about it. You figure out what you want by experiencing it, and then evaluating that experience.

Overcoming porn addiction is no different. 

You do a heap of things and if something works, then you succeed.

Of course, the great thing about NeverFap is that you no longer have to waste your time doing things that do not work.

You can just commit to the practices and exercises on this website, and you'll pretty much be alright. 

Otherwise, the alterative is to continue asking 'why' and hope that we have some sudden spark of awareness which will magically alter our brain to somehow overcome years of bad habits which we seemingly reinforce on a daily basis with our actions.

Good luck with that.

In fact, there’s a word used to describe what it means to ask ‘why’ all the time. 

<hr/>

### It’s called rumination, and I personally consider it a form of self-harm. 

<hr/>

Rumination is when you continually spur over your thoughts, without actually pursuing any hard actions as a result.

Understandably it is an instinctive human response to ask ‘why’. Through reasonable questioning we can create logic and reason, which allows us to paint a clearer picture of the world around us. 

Which is great for creating an initial assessment, but beyond that, it simply becomes a pointless burden.

Here's the deal. 

We are all human and those of us with similar goals, will require to develop the same set of skills, regardless of what we think.

In the case of basketball, it’s learning to dribble, shoot, block and run with the ball. It doesn’t matter if you’re of Turkish descent, had five siblings, was hit by a car at age 12, can barely speak English etc. Those are the core skills you are going to have to learn, one way or another.  

Sure, understanding why dribbling is important is something which may help you better understand those skills, however the core skills themselves are undeniable.

<hr/>

### Another way of putting it is that we must focus on the how, rather than the why. 

<hr/>

The understanding is the why, while the core skills are the how.

When we focus on how to achieve something, we no longer become concerned with trying to define our reality. Instead, we become actively focused on the actions which help us change our reality for the better. 

<hr/>

**"How am I a porn addict?"** 

**"What do I on a daily basis which makes me a porn addict?"** 

**"What do I have to do in order to avoid porn addiction?"**

<hr/>

By changing the way you think from trying to understand reason, to trying to understand tangible processes, you also completely change the way you think about your problems. 

They no longer become about building narratives or perceptions of who you are, and instead become focused on the mechanical details of what makes you drawn to porn.

Because at the end of the day, addiction is a process. 

It is something you actively engage in and contribute towards. 

Attempting to understand why this process exists (although helpful in some contexts) is a really indirect way of trying to influence how it functions. 

And this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. 

To be a little bit more precise, here are a list of the why’s which you don’t need to worry about:

<hr/>

**"Why am I a porn addict?"**

**"Why do I find overcoming porn addiction so difficult?"**

<hr/>

These are all meaningless questions. Instead, these are the types of questions we need to be thinking about:

<hr/>

**"What can I do to influence my porn addiction?"**

**"What are the steps leading up to when I watch porn?"**

**"How do I think about women?"**

**"How do I fall into the trap of believing that it’s okay to watch porn?"**

<hr/>

Aside from the rest of the introductory articles on this website, I highly recommend taking a look at some of the practices on offer, so you can begin to make actual changes to your life today.
