<!-- Very happy with edit -->

It's a question you've probably been thinking about for a while.

**“Why am I a porn addict?”**

It's undeniable that attempting to gain an understand into why we became porn addicts in the first place can be interesting, if not somewhat fulfilling.

Humans are full of questions, and satisfying that curiosity is part of what we do as humans.

However to be quite honest, understanding why we are something is a lot less relevant to figuring out how to change it. 

{{< hr3 "In fact, trying to understand why porn addicts, is one of the biggest traps that porn addicts fall into.">}}

It’s like trying to figure out your life purpose by asking the question:

**“Why do I exist?”**

Well, I can tell you now that why you exist has no correlation to what purpose you have in life. 

You can have purpose for absolutely any reason imaginable, as you can be a porn addict for any number of reasons. 

On the other hand, if you actually want to figure out your life purpose, then I suggest doing a heap of things and seeing what sticks.

{{< hr3 "You see, you don't figure out what you want in life by thinking about it." >}}

You figure out what you want by experiencing it, and then evaluating that experience.

Overcoming porn addiction is no different. 

It's also about doing a heap of different things and seeing what works and what does not.

Of course, you obviously don't need to be so brash and uninformed with your approach.

Much like how you don't need to murder someone to realise that you probably don't want to become a full-time murderer. 

You also understand that there are guides and resources out there to help you overcome your porn addiction. 

{{< hr3 "The great thing about NeverFap Deluxe is that you no longer have to waste your time doing things that do not work." >}}
 

You can just commit to the practices and exercises on this website, and you'll pretty much be alright. 

Otherwise, the alterative is to continue asking 'why' and hope that we have some sudden spark of awareness which will magically alter our brain.

Good luck with that.

In fact, there’s a word used to describe what it means to incessant ask why all the time. 


{{< hr3 "It’s called rumination." >}}

And I personally consider it a form of self-harm.

Rumination is when you continually spur over your thoughts, without actually pursuing any hard actions as a result.

Understandably, it is an instinctive human response to ask why. 

But when we do it excessively, it serves no purpose and it becomes a literally bottleneck in terms of our ability to process and produce information. 

{{< hr3 "Which is to say that asking why is great for creating an initial assessment, however beyond that it becomes nothing more than a pointless burden." >}}

If we look at something like learning to play basketball, it's clear there are a number of key skills we must learn. 

For example, there's dribbling, shooting, blocking and learning to run with the ball. 

It doesn’t matter if you don't understand what materials a basketball is made of, nor even who invented basketball. 

Regardless of what your understanding is of basketball, those are the core skills you are going to have to learn.  

<!-- Which is to say that while dribbling is important, practicing dribbling  -->

<!-- 

 is something which may help you better understand those skills, however the core skills themselves are undeniable.

 -->

{{< hr3 "Another way of putting it is that we must focus on the how, rather than the why." >}}


The understanding is the why, while the core skills are the how.

When we focus on how to achieve something, we no longer become concerned with trying to define our reality. Instead, we become actively focused on the actions which help us change our reality for the better. 

<hr class="hrul"/>

**"How am I a porn addict?"** 

**"What do I on a daily basis which makes me a porn addict?"** 

**"What do I have to do in order to avoid porn addiction?"**

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

By changing the way you think from trying to understand reason, to trying to understand tangible processes, you also completely change the way you think about your problems. 

They no longer become about building narratives or perceptions of who you are, and instead become focused on the mechanical details of what makes you drawn to porn.

Because at the end of the day, addiction is a process. 

It is something you actively engage in and contribute towards. 

Attempting to understand why this process exists (although helpful in some contexts) is a really indirect way of trying to influence how it functions. 

And this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. 

To be a little bit more precise, here are a list of the why’s which you don’t need to worry about:

<hr class="hrul"/>

**"Why am I a porn addict?"**

**"Why do I find overcoming porn addiction so difficult?"**

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

These are all meaningless questions. Instead, these are the types of questions we need to be thinking about:

<hr class="hrul"/>

**"What can I do to influence my porn addiction?"**

**"What are the steps leading up to when I watch porn?"**

**"How do I think about women?"**

**"How do I fall into the trap of believing that it’s okay to watch porn?"**

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

Aside from the rest of the introductory articles on this website, I highly recommend taking a look at some of the practices on offer, so you can begin to make actual changes to your life today.
