If I had to describe the most important thing you could do for your porn addiction, I would say that practicing meditation on a daily basis is what will help you the most.


{{< hr4 "In fact, ten minutes of meditation a night is probably enough for most porn addicts to overcome their addiction." >}}


Of course, this is a lot easier said than done.

The reason why we teach you all these other additional skills, is so you can learn to actually stick to some sort of meditation routine. 

Which isn't going to happen unless if you understand all the context behind how we achieve that here at NeverFap Deluxe.

Although, the rational is simple.


{{< hr2 "Why meditation?" >}}


Without going too deep into the intricate details of how to meditate, nor necessarily what meditation is, let's talk about what meditation effectively achieves. 

In essence, meditation is the most powerful way I know how to help us regain power over our emotions.

Not just our emotions, but our thoughts, feelings and everything associated with the inherent functioning of our brain.

Here's the deal, being a porn addict has changed the way your brain works. 

It's no longer stable.

{{< hr3 "What meditation allows you to do is develop the ability to maintain control over your mind." >}}

Yet, even if porn has influenced the way your brain functions on an emotional level.

Chances are that you never developed the the ability to control your mind growing up. Chances are that you weren't taught appropriate coping mechanisms.

Like not taking things personally or maintaining balance throughout your life.

Well, meditation is your ticket out of this mess.

Meditation teaches you control.


{{< hr2 "Meditation and Porn addiction" >}}


Overcoming porn addiction is actually a relatively straight forward process.

It largely comes down to developing control over your emotions, as well as developing an understanding of how your mind works in relation to them.

What does this mean in practice?

In terms of developing control over your emotions, it means remaining calm when you're experiencing a porn craving or if you're feeling depressed. 

In terms of understanding your emotions, it means not taking your emotions personally when craving porn, and acknowledging that it's merely your brain respond how it should under a state of addiction.

{{< hr4 "Honestly, if you can manage to do those things, you'll be 90% of the way there." >}}

Yet most people struggle.

Because they don't meditate on a frequent basis, because they don't understand their emotions and because they simply don't have control over their minds. 

That's why meditation is important, because it provides you with that control in order to face these challenges without hesitation or fear.


{{< hr4 "When you have control over your emotions, it makes situations where you don't necessarily feel in control manageable." >}}


Yes. 

Manageable.

Because successfully overcoming porn addiction is largely about learning to navigate through and manage your emotions so that you're in control of your desired outcomes.

And you can't manage your emotions if you don't have mastery over your mind, and your ability to produce and regulate them.

So what exactly are some of the skills and practices of meditation? 

For starters, there is observation. 


{{< hr4 "Observation is perhaps the most fundamental skill in regards to meditation and developing awareness." >}}


It is the skill we will learn and develop most throughout the practices here on NeverFap Deluxe.

<!-- TODO: If you'd like to find out more, you can read more about it in my article the power of observation -->

In part, because it's really hard to take something personally or lose our frame of reference when we're merely observing reality.

The moment we stop observing is when we begin actually interacting with the world around us, and in particular, stop remaining actively remaining aware of what is happening around us. 

Aside from observation, there is also introspection (our ability to look into ourselves), perspective (changing the way we think about things), as well as a whole range of different skills we can use to influence and change the way our minds operate.

These skills are broken into Five Fundamental Principles which allow us to focus on particular outcomes related to overcoming porn addiction.
