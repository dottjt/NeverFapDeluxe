NeverFap Deluxe aims to be a comprehensive solution towards addressing your porn addiction. 

While there are many resources out there on the internet which accurate describe what porn addiction is and how it functions, I couldn't find a single resource that could accurately tell me <u>exactly what I needed to do</u> in order stop being a porn addict.

Which is like saying: "Hey buddy, you have a severe problem, but I won't actually tell you how to address it, however what I'll do instead is make you increasingly aware of it, so that you feel compelled to do something about it, even though I don't exactly know what you need to do to change".

Ultimately, there were two kinds of resources that I frequently came across:

<hr class="hrul"/>

- Incomplete advice from existing porn addicts, usually in the form of forum posts, which were desperately hopeful at best.

- Scientific descriptions as to what porn addiction is and how it affects various aspects of our mind and physical bodies.

<hr class="hrul"/>

While it's great to understand what happens under the hood from a scientific point of view, in no way does it actually help me deal with the day-to-day of being a porn addict.

So lieu of all this.

NeverFap has one very clear purpose that other websites lack: 

To help you successfully (and thus, easily) overcome porn addiction. 

The reason why NeverFap works is because it is built around verifiable steps and practices, which actively change the way we feel and think on a daily basis. 

Using these practices, I have personally overcome porn addiction to a point that I literally do not think about porn at all. 

In addition, the NeverFap method of overcoming porn addiction has been built around Five Fundamental Principles, which serve to help you not only better understand yourself, but cut through the denial of being a porn addict.

Aside from the fact that NeverFap is a complete solution that aims to take you from porn addict to regular human being, we also take a very unique approach towards addressing porn addiction.

You see, I maintain a very strong belief that porn addiction has very little to do with porn itself. 

Understandably, watching and masturbating to porn is an incredibly addictive behaviour. 

However this doesn't explain why some people aren't severe porn addicts in the same way that were are, in the same way that I'm not addicted to alcohol in the same that some other people are. 

And this is precisely where I believe scientific descriptions of porn addiction break down.

Sure, it's interesting to understand how porn addiction works, but it still doesn't quite explain why some people are absolutely obsessed with it.

<u>I don't believe that porn is the underlying issue</u>.

Rather, I believe that porn addicts are addicted to porn because of some sort of fundamental misunderstanding that they have subscribed to, which they are also completely oblivious to.

Not only is this a reflection of my own experience, but a reflection on the actual practices and solutions out there which work to help address porn addiction.


{{< hr3 "What are we misunderstanding?" >}}


When you think about it, no one wants to be an addict. 

No one wants to self-harm and pursue behaviours which cause them suffering and misery. 

The only reason they do, even inspite of trying to break their addiction, is because they fail to understand not only what's possible, but how to turn what's possible into a reality.

In some cases, this misunderstanding can be due to a limiting belief they have about their own ability to overcome porn addiction. 

In other cases, they may simply not have the mental capacity to influence their emotions in order to prevent cravings, usually due to lack of practice.

In most cases, it's a combination of a number of factors, which they simply haven't figured out are the issue. 

This is why I came up with the Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap, to help guide people towards understanding exactly where they may be having that misunderstanding.

Perhaps what I like most about NeverFap is how it is designed to always provide you with a path forward.

When you're a porn addict, almost everything is confusing. 

You doubt yourself. You second-guess what you're experiencing. And even though you know  

With NeverFap there's always an opportunity to try and figure out where you went wrong, and figure out exactly where you are at your weakest and how to address that. 

At the end of the day, overcoming porn addiction is nothing more than a skill, and it's a skill you gain through practice. 

The more you practice, the more you build your confidence and eventually, you'll be to fully control whatever outcomes you desire. 

That's my guarantee. 

Because I've done and I'm living proof it works, so you can too.
