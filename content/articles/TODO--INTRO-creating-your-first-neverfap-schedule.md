<!-- Talk about how having a plan is part of a good routine. -->

Everything in life revolves around practice. 

No matter what you want to do in life, practice is the means through which we get good at something.

Overcoming porn addiction is really no different. 

If you're going to have any chance against addressing your porn addiction, you're going to have to practice the core skills involved to help you regain control over your mind.

And the only way this is going to happen, is if you have an effective routine of practice in place.

This means understanding why these practices are effective.

This means finding the time to actually practie them.

Most importantly, this means actually doing the practices with consistency.

{{< hr3 "To start out, I recommend spending approximately 10 minutes per day practicing observation." >}}

Specifically, the <a class="link" href="/practices/observe-it-all">Observe it all</a> practice which should become the fundamental basis of everything you do.

It's the one practice I do everday, and it can be thought of the most fundamental exercise you can do towards developing your awareness.

It's more-or-less the only one I personally do, in part because I've already practices all the other exercises over the past five years.

Which although incredibly useful, are merely supplementary to your ability to simply remain aware and observe.

What I recommend is doing is <u>Observe it all</u>, along with a supplementary exercise. 





{{< hr2 "My Personal Routine" >}}

I have a very basic routine which works well for me.







In essence, these exercises are basic thought and perspective exercises that you can do each day. 

And they are absolutely fundamental to changing the way you think.

{{< hr3 "Self-care routine" >}}

So after all this, you're probably wondering what an optimal self-care routine is? 

Well, I suppose a good place to start is with what I personally do on a daily/weekly basis. From there, I can extrapolate upon which aspects I believe are most important.

<hr class="hrul"/>

- I eat paleo.
- I do cardio and lift weights three times a week.
- I have a consistent sleep routine.
- I work on my hobbies and ambitions in my spare time.
- I play video games and watch TV to relax.
- I meditate approximately three times a day.
- I work a typical nine-to-five job.
- I brush my teeth in the morning and at night.
- I have a cold shower every night.

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

These are the things that I do on a daily basis which keep me regular.

Now an interesting thing to note is that realistically, in terms of achieving NeverFap, you don't need to do most of those things. In fact, I was personally doing most of those things while still being a pornography addict. 

In fact, it wasn't until I began adding meditation to my routine that I was finally able to overcome my porn addiction. 

So it's quite possible that all you need to do to overcome porn addiction is to learn to control your mind through meditation.
