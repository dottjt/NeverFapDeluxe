If you're going to have any chance against your porn addiction, you're going to have to practice the core skills involved which will help you regain control over your mind.

And the only way you're going to practice effectively is if you have a consistent schedule of practices in place.

This means finding the time.

That is approximately 4% of your day. 5.5% of your day if you don't include sleep. 10% of your day if you don't include work.

And they are absolutely fundamental to changing the way you think.
