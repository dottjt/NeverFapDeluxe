<!-- Talk about how having a plan is part of a good routine. -->

If you're going to have any chance against your porn addiction, you're going to have to practice the core skills involved which will help you regain control over your mind.

And the only way you're going to practice effectively is if you have a consistent schedule of practices in place.

This means finding the time.



{{< hr3 "I recommend spending approximately one hour each day towards developing your mental health." >}}



That is approximately 4% of your day. 5.5% of your day if you don't include sleep. 10% of your day if you don't include work. 

It may seem like a lot of time, but what people don't realise is that you gain more time back than you invest in.

I talk more about it in my article <a class="link" href="/articles/you-always-have-time-for-your-mental-health">You Always Have Time For Your Mental Health</a>.

In essence, these exercises are basic thought and perspective exercises that you can do each day. 

And they are absolutely fundamental to changing the way you think.

{{< hr3 "Self-care routine" >}}

So after all this, you're probably wondering what an optimal self-care routine is? 

Well, I suppose a good place to start is with what I personally do on a daily/weekly basis. From there, I can extrapolate upon which aspects I believe are most important.

<hr class="hrul"/>

- I eat paleo.
- I do cardio and lift weights three times a week.
- I have a consistent sleep routine.
- I work on my hobbies and ambitions in my spare time.
- I play video games and watch TV to relax.
- I meditate approximately three times a day.
- I work a typical nine-to-five job.
- I brush my teeth in the morning and at night.
- I have a cold shower every night.

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

These are the things that I do on a daily basis which keep me regular.

Now an interesting thing to note is that realistically, in terms of achieving NeverFap, you don't need to do most of those things. In fact, I was personally doing most of those things while still being a pornography addict. 

In fact, it wasn't until I began adding meditation to my routine that I was finally able to overcome my porn addiction. 

So it's quite possible that all you need to do to overcome porn addiction is to learn to control your mind through meditation.
