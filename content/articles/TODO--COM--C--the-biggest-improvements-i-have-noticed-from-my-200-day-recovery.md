I find it really hard to write this because I haven't experienced the effects of porn, masturbation and orgasm for so long that it's truly become a distant memory to me.

Which I suppose is the first thing to note about what happens when you do eventually become recovered.

It honestly feels as if you were never addicted to porn to begin with, and I really cannot

For the first time in my life, I finally realise what it means to be 'normal'. Like, truly normal in the sense of feeling like this is what the real 'me' actually feels like.

Like, the version of me which I've always wanted to be, and always dreamed of, but could never quite figure out in any capacity.

In terms of actual benefits there are a few key areas I want to discuss.

And before I continue I'd to preface this information with a a very important point discovery I've come to realise in regards to overcoming porn addiction.

Essentially, I would personally argue that most the benefits are not specific to overcoming porn addiction.

Instead, I would say most the benefits simply derive from no longer being an addict, which is inclusive of the mindset and personality of addiction.

On top of that, also working on my mental health feeling empowered from that.

So I feel like it's irrelevant that my addiction happened to be masturbation to porn, as I'll soon explain in detail.

The first thing I'd like to note is the energy increase that comes with no longer masturbating on a daily basis.

Obviously, because orgasm is draining, however I think a large part of it actually has to do with the feelings and emotions of being an addict, as opposed to the physical effects of orgasm.

For example, no longer feeling the guilt and shame that came with being an addict, not to mention the complete helplessness I would feel in relation to my being unable to control myself.

Those are the aspects of my addiction which I believe had the biggest toll on me, and to have all of that completely disappear from my life - is like having the world's heaviest weight's off my shoulders.

I feel truly free for the first time in my life, and wow. I couldn't possibly describe what that feels like in any coherent way.

I'm focused. I'm in-control of my thoughts. Most of all, I'm powerful. I feel so incredibly powerful because I get to dictate how I used my mind, not the other way around.

And that really signifies the biggest benefit from my own personal point of view - I now have the power and energy in order to be able to pursue my ambitions effortlessly.

No more being motivated for a week, only to relapse and therefore affect my overall mood, which also affects my motivation with my career.

I have literally become a machine of productivity. Like, I more-or-less have zero downtime now and you know the best part?

I haven't burnt out.

As someone with bipolar disorder, I used to burn out every 2 - 3 weeks or so, resulting in a few weeks of depression and demotivation and it became this viscious cycle which eventually caused me to give up, as it simply became too unbearable to want to move forward.

Now that I have control over my mind, I really am not joking when I say that I've become a machine.

I can work with full focus, almost permanently and because I'm meditating and maintaining my mental health, there's no overhead.

I have no need to relax. I have no need to 'decompress'. I am motivated and functional like a well-oiled machine.

From an emotional perspective, it's like... everything has become effortless. I'm no longer fighting myself. I'm remaining stable and aware of my thoughts and behaviours.

Like, this is what 'normal' is. I'm functionally normally for the first time and it's so incredibly enabling that it's just mind-blowing when I come to think about it.

Really, that word 'enabling' I feel truly describes how I feel.

I now feel enabled to just be awesome.
