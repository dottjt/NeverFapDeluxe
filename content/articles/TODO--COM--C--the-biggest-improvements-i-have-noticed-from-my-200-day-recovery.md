I find it really hard to write this because I haven't experienced the effects of porn, masturbation and orgasm for so long that it's truly become a distant memory to me.

Largely because I've so routinely stuck to my mental health regime that it's not even something I have to think about. 

I just know what I have to do to get through each day with a positive and healthy mindset, and my thoughts end there. 

Which I suppose is the first thing to note about what happens when you do eventually recover from your porn addiction.


{{< hr3 "It honestly feels as if you were never addicted to porn to begin with." >}}


For the first time in my life, I've finally come to realise what it means to be this word 'normal'.

Like, truly normal in the sense of feeling like this is what the real 'me' actually feels like.

And unlike what I thought normal would be as this average drudge into adulthood, being normal is actually one of the most exciting and encouraging things I have ever felt in my entire life.

Like, it's the version of me which I've always wanted to be and always dreamed of, but could never quite figure out in any capacity, and it's something which truly needs to be experienced to be understood.


{{< hr3 "In terms of hard benefits there are a few key areas I would like to discuss." >}}


And before I continue this article, I'd to preface this information with a very important point I've come to discover about porn addiction recovery. 

Put simply, I would argue that most the benefits you receive from no longer being a porn addict are not specific to porn itself.

Instead, I would say most of the benefits simply derive from no longer being an addict, which is inclusive of the mindset and personality of addiction.

So I feel it doesn't really matter if it's porn, alcohol, weed or masturbation - the positive benefits are relative to no longer being an addict, rather than because of the category of addiction itself. 

Of course, that isn't to say that there are positive side-effects which aren't porn specific, however this is my overall assessment. 

In addition, I would like to add that most of these benefits are due to the work I've put into my mental health, rather than because I'm no longer an addict.

While obviously no longer being an addict contributes significantly to my mental health, I would say that the work I've dedicated towards my mental health trumps those efforts. 

Anyway, I digress. I just thought it would be important to point out. 


{{< hr3 "The first thing I'd like to note is the energy increase that I've experienced from no longer masturbating on a daily basis." >}}


Obviously, in part because orgasm is inherently draining on both a physical and emotion level.

However, I think a large part of it actually has to do no longer feeling those feelings of guilt and shame that came with masturbating daily, often because I was hiding my habit from others.

Not to mention the complete helplessness I would feel in relation to my being unable to control myself, and how that affected me mentally on a daily basis.

This emotional toll is what I believe had the biggest impact on me in terms of how I felt as a human being.

...and to have all of that completely disappear from my life, is like having the world's heaviest weight's taken from my shoulders. It makes me want to cry thinking about it. 

I feel truly free for the first time in my life, and wow. I couldn't possibly describe what that feels like in any coherent way.

I'm focused. I'm in control of my thoughts. Most of all, I'm powerful. I feel so incredibly powerful because I get to dictate how I used my mind, not the other way around.

And that really signifies the biggest benefit from my own personal point of view - I now have the power and energy in order to be able to pursue my ambitions effortlessly.

No more being motivated for a week, only to relapse and therefore affect my overall mood, which also affects my motivation with my career.

I have literally become a machine of productivity. Like, I more-or-less have zero downtime now and you know the best part?

I haven't burnt out.

As someone with bipolar disorder, I used to burn out every 2 - 3 weeks or so, resulting in a few weeks of depression and demotivation and it became this viscious cycle which eventually caused me to give up, as it simply became too unbearable to want to move forward.

Now that I have control over my mind, I really am not joking when I say that I've become a machine.

I can work with full focus, almost permanently and because I'm meditating and maintaining my mental health, there's no overhead.

I have no need to relax. I have no need to 'decompress'. I am motivated and functional like a well-oiled machine.

From an emotional perspective, it's like... everything has become effortless. I'm no longer fighting myself. I'm remaining stable and aware of my thoughts and behaviours.

Like, this is what 'normal' is. I'm functionally normally for the first time and it's so incredibly enabling that it's just mind-blowing when I come to think about it.

Really, that word 'enabling' I feel truly describes how I feel.

I now feel enabled to just be awesome.


Another significant aspect which has changed is the way I view sex and women. In particular, I no longer obsess over sex and I no longer view women as sex objects. 

I mean, sure. I'm still a guy. I still love women. I still want to more-or-less have sex with every womanI see. That's just part of being male.

But it's not something that dominates my mind in any capacity. I have a million other focuses in my mind, like actively wanting to maintain my mental health or focusing on my work.
