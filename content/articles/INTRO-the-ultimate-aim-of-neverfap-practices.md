NeverFap Deluxe consists of a range of exercises which are designed to help you develop the skills in order to help you overcome porn addiction.

The intention really is quite simple:

{{< hr3 "To develop healthy coping mechanisms to help deal with your porn addiction" >}}

And the way we achieve this is by learning to become comfortable with ourselves, our feelings and our emotions.

Here's the thing: If you are a porn addict, then in a lot of situations watching porn is your go-to response for a variety of situations.

It could be stress. It could be depression. It could simply be due to the fact that you've never be taught otherwise.

So with these exercises, what we are essentially doing is creating a separate pathway of understanding so you don't need to watch porn.

{{< hr3 "And the way we get you to do this is by practicing these healthy coping mechanisms so that they can become second-nature to you." >}}

So that you can learn to relax or even embrace those negative feelings and not take them personally.

Don't worry, we'll teach you them all, and from there you can decide what you feel most comfortable with.

{{< hr2 "The process of self-discovery" >}}

An important thing to note is that since what we're doing is learning to become comfortable with our feelings and emotions, that this is ultimately a process of self-discovery.

There are no right or wrong answers with these exercises. 

There is merely how you feel in the present moment, both when practicing these exercises and when not. 

As a result, observation is an incredibly important aspect of what we're trying to achieve.

Because observation is what allows us to engage our brain and think about our feelings and behaviours.

Otherwise, we aren't truly being aware of what we're doing, and we have less to gain.
 
<!-- In fact, a lot of the skills which we will be learning specifically revolve around how we can  -->
