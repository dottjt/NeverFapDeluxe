There is one super simple way to identify a judgement.

And I'm honestly surprised no one else has come up with this before (perhaps they have, but I personally haven't seen it described like this).


{{ hr3 "Put simply, pay attention to when you have an emotional reaction." }}


It's a method that works like a charm, and it works a little something like this.

When we make a judgement, we're inherently putting our faith into an idea.

It could be that something is wrong. That something is amazing. It really could be anything you think of.

And when we do this, it makes us feel a certain way. 

When we do something wrong it can make us feel anger or frustration. When we do something amazing, it can fill us with feelings of joy and excitement.


{{ hr3 "The point is that how you feel is often determined by what you've invested your faith in." }}


So the key here is to pay attention to what you're feeling. 

Try and understand why you feel that particular way.  



The great thing about identifying judgements is that it is that we don't need to go any further than simply acknowledging them.

Often where people feel trapped is that they then feel as if they need to dissect them and get to the root cause of why we're being judgemental. 

Truth is, that judgements don't have any inherent meaning.

After all, if judgements are pointlessly harmful, then what meaning could they actually have outside of the automatic response with which we generate them with?

So really, once you identify a judgement, all that's required is to simply detach from it.
