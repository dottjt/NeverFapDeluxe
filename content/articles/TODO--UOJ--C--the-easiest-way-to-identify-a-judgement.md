Some people have a hard time identifying the judgements they make on a daily basis.

It could be because they judge out of habit and therefore are doing it subsciously without realising it, or perhaps because they're simply unable to recognise judgements for what they are.

Certainly, I had no idea that half the thoughts I used to produce were out-right judgements, and it took me years to personally identify them all and realise the extent to which I was being judgemental.

Of course, I'm writing this article today so you can have a much easier time identifying the judgement you make on a daily basis.

Ultimately, there's a super simple way we can instantly identify the judgements we make throughout the day, and furthermore it doesn't require paying a therapist hundreds of dollars either. 


{{< hr3 "Pay attention to your emotional reactions." >}}


Your emotion reactions are a key indicator of whether you've made a judgement or not, and in order to understand why we need to understand what emotional reactions are.

Emotional reactions don't simply appear out of nowhere. 

They only exist because we've reacted to something, usually a deep-seated belief or thought we have about something.

This is where judgements come in. 


{{< hr3 "You see, judgements are much more than mere thoughts." >}}


If they were just like any other thought, then much like most thoughts we have, they would disappear completely from our conscious never to bother us again.

For example, while most of us are unable to remember any memories, thoughts or opinions we had of the weather more than a few weeks ago. 

Most of us can probably remember when our parents made us do things that upset us greatly and made us really mad, even if these events may have taken place more than a decade ago.

In essence, what makes judgements different is that unlike normal thoughts, judgements are thoughts that are backed by excessive belief. 

For example, the belief that we did not deserve to be punished, or the belief that we're not trying hard enough (also known as self-criticism).


{{< hr3 "When we make a judgement, we inherently put our faith into that thought or opinion." >}}


And when we do this, we create expectations for how we are going to react on an emotional level.

<b>"If that person doesn't shut up, I'm going to get so mad!"</b>

<b>"If I fail this test, I'm going to feel so helpless and depression."</b>

Often these agreements and expectations are subtle in that we won't necessarily vocalise what our agreements are.

Instead, we create implicit agreements like how we're going to feel sad if we don't have a girlfriend or how we're going to feel upset if we don't commit to our mental health plan.

This in part is the reason why these judgements can be so hard to identify, because often these agreements are completely hidden from conscious sight. 


{{< hr3 "Yet from the perspective of our emotional reactions, they are not hidden at all.">}}


This is when we feel the effect of those judgements the most, and so paying attention to what you're feeling can be a key indicator as to whether you're making a judgement or not.

And it's only until we can identify these judgements through our emotional reactions, that we can move on and learn not to react.

<!-- TODO: Article to talk about how to truly identify judgement -->

Of course, you're probably wondering. I'm making all these judgements, but what can I actually do about them?

How is identifying them going to help?


{{< hr3 "Well, the great thing is that we don't need to go any further than simple acknowledgement." >}}


Because anything further that you do at this point, is further rationalisation which is the exact opposite to what we are trying to achieve.

Effectively, what we want to do is learn to let go of these judgements, and learn to simply function irregardless of them. 

Where people often go wrong is that they feel trapped once they've identified these judgements, as if they've done some great evil.

Then they feel the need to dissect them, or rectify all these behviours and habits.

The funny thing is that this within itself is an emotional reaction, brought about by judgement. For example, you may have the judgement that you're not good enough, and therefore feel the need to do something about it. 


{{< hr3 "Which in part signifies the extent to which a lot of the judgements are simply subconscious habit." >}}


Remember, no matter what our emotional reaction or judgement, our go-to response is to acknowledge that we've had an emotional reaction and judgement, and simply move on.

Once you acknowledge something, it takes you out of the reaction, which helps you in terms of remaining calm and refraining from reacting further.

Of course, like anything practice makes perfect.

And by using healthy coping mechanisms such as meditation, we can go a long way towards developing control over our judgements and emotions.
