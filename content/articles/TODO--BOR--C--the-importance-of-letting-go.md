Some people have a very difficult time letting go.

They could have a hard time letting go of their own feelings, regardless of whether these feelings are productive, nor make us feel empowered about who we are. 

They could have a hard time letting go of their own thoughts, as they find themselves paralyzed in indecision and incessant rationality and judgement.

This may even extend to the toxic people in our lives, or even the self-limiting beliefs we have about ourselves that we're simply "not good enough" or "undeserving" of love and attention.

Regardless of what it is we're struggling with, the solution all points to the same thing.

Of course, if it were that simple none of us would have any problems, and we'd all be clear of our addiction and a-ok to continue with our lives.

Well, today I'm here to discuss not only the importance of letting go, but also how you can achieve that by changing the way we think about attachment.

Part of the reason why pepole struggle with letting go, is because there's a great fear and misunderstanding of what letting go truly is.

At first glance people assume the worst.

They see letting go as inherently losing something, in particular, a part of themselves. 

Letting go then becomes this deep-seated fear that part of us may disappear forever, never to return - leaving this hollow shell of nothingness.


{{< hr3 "Inspite of the fact that this sentiment literally makes zero sense what-so-ever." >}}


You see, you don't actually lose anything by letting go.

There is no 'void' once something leaves. 

If you think of the conscious experience as a bunch of brain waves moving forward, those waves don't suddenly disappear the moment you let something go. 

The only time this happens is when you die, and since you're still very much alive and conscious once you let go, then those waves will keep chugging along at the same rate as it did prior to when you didn't let go.

So what actually happens then?


{{< hr3 "Well, what happens is that it allows you to experience different waves." >}}


Much like those brain waves which are being produced each second, it can help to think of the brain as a conveyor belt in an ice-cream factory. 

Regardless of which flavour of ice-cream you decide to produce, that conveyor belt is still going to be producing ice-cream none-the-less. 

If you think of all the awful things in your life as terrible flavours of ice-cream, then letting go of them isn't going to suddenly stop that conveyor-belt.

Instead, what happens is quite remarkable.

What happens is that you begin producing neutral, vanilla ice-cream. Not worse ice-cream, just normal, plain ice-cream. 

It's not the best ice-cream in the world, but it's certainly not the worst. 

Which is to say that by letting go of those awful flavours, you essentially allow yourself the opportuinty to start from scratch and create amazing new ones.

It's an opportunity to experience 






In this article I hope to demonstrate some of the very real reasons why it's important to meditate and practice awareness.





For example, it could be a website that you visit every single day. It could be staying back at work later than you're required to. 


 it's actually a feeling based in this deep-seated responsibility we've created over time.


The trick is to realise nothing is important (nothing is important except the present moment). I want to talk about some of the very real reasons why it's important to  exercises.

Today I want to talk about obligation.

What it is, how we relate to it and how we use it to distort our ability to behave and act.

Unlike responsibility, obligation
