So you're probably wondering.


### Who on earth is this kid?

<hr/>

I'm a writer, a web developer, and avid entrepeneur.

<hr/>

I came across porn at a very young age, perhaps no different to yourself. 

In fact, I started watching porn from the very moment I figured out how to masturbate at the age of 10.

Again, nothing out of the ordinary.

I'm not exactly sure when I decided that I wanted to give up porn, but I suppose there have been a variety of serious attempts through out my life.

My very first attempt at giving up porn began at age 16, where I thought I'd try to give up porn for the hell of it.

I managed to abstain for approximately 3 weeks, which was pretty amazing at the time.

It then wasn't until I was around 20 years old that I began to recognise that porn was an actual problem. 

A problem which I was determined to understand and overcome. 

Fast forward a few years and...

<hr/>

<h3>Age 25. October 20th 2018.</h3>

<hr/>

This is the last time I have (and ever will) masturbate to or watch porn ever again.

You know when you have that moment when everything clicks, and absolutely everything comes together and makes sense? 

I had that moment and it was awesome.

So what changed?

It's hard to say exactly why I experienced that moment, but up until then I'd:

- Done the whole Paleo diet thing
- Studied various books and perspective course on mental health
- Took cold showers everyday before bed
- Ate only one meal a day (via intermittent fasting)
- Was doing Leangains and lifting weights three times a week
- Was in an amazing, supportive relationship
- Worked obscenely hard to get a job as a programmer

Like, I was essentially do everything I could have done right. 

...and yet probably 90% of that had nothing to do with why I'd managed to successfully give up porn.

<hr/>

## The truth of giving up porn addiction

<hr/>

In retrospect, giving up porn is actually a relatively simple, straight forward process.

Ha.

I suppose there were two main catalysts as to why I've remained porn free since.

And it all happened within the space of a few weeks. 

<hr />

### For starters I had a breakdown. 

<hr />

You see, I suffer from a condition from Bipolar Disorder and I hadn't told my partner about it. 

In part, because I thought she already knew (since then I've learnt to never assume), because I refused to acknowledge it myself and because it wasn't something I ever felt comfortable talking. 

However one day I was feeling particularly vulnerable and I felt like I had to talk to someone about it. 

What I learnt was that she had no idea, even though we'd been together for around four years up until that point.

A few things happened as a result.

Now that she was aware of my disorder, I could now be honest about all the things I was hiding from her, including my porn addiction.

Because let me tell you, it's really hard to overcome something when you're hiding it from everyone, especially when you're telling them that you're not doing the thing that you're hiding.

Not only does the guilt eat away at you, but without having someone to talk about it with, it's hard to ask for help when you need it most. 

In addition, I'd hit a point in my life where I could no longer cope, and in talking about it with someone, decided to take it seriously. 

Understanding and recognising my disorder, which I'd previously dismissed, helped me better understand my emotions and therefore, manage them a lot more easily. 

The main benefit however, was the sense of confidence it gave me to actually approach my problems.

I finally felt free to just move on with my life.

The second catalyst, which in part came about from the first catalyst, was perhaps more profound. 

<hr />

### What happened was that I'd discovered this little thing called 'meditation'.

<hr />

The funny thing about meditation is that I'd tried doing it through out various phases of my life to no avail.

It didn't seem to help. It didn't really seem to do anything at all.

However following my break down, I'd decided to take my mental health seriously and consider practices which would help me better manage my emotions.

I'd literally only started meditating a few weeks after my last attempt at quiting porn, and I can say that within two weeks of meditating...

I'd learnt more about how to manage my porn addiction than in absolutely everything I'd done in the past five years to try and curb my addiction.

Absolutely incredible. 

If I had one piece of advice to anyone wanting to seriously overcome porn addiction, **start meditating today**.

Of course, it'd be almost foolish to claim that everything I'd done up until then didn't have any impact on my life.

But man, meditating gave me super powers. 

It provided me with the ability to fully control my mind, something which I hadn't experienced before. 

And I want to help you experience that to.
