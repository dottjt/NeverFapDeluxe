It's sort of interesting to observe those who do really well with NeverFap Deluxe, and those who simply don't.

Well, not so much interesting, as it's becoming painfully obvious.

You see, when you talk to hundreds of porn addicts everyday, it becomes quite clear almost immediately, why a person is struggling.

And as a guide of sorts, it's my job to try and desperately guide people and explain to them what they should be doing and why.

It can be a frustrating job at times, because although you can literally see their thoughts and their short-comings in vivid detail, it's often impossible for me to describe those details in any meaningful way.

Although we're all speaking the same language, that doesn't necessarily translate in a way that is meaningful in terms of getting a person to take constructive action.

The problem is that this idea of 'awareness' is such an individual concept that it's almost impossible to truly explain what it actually is to someone.

Especially when you talk to porn addicts who are inherently delusional, and who adamantly believe that there is nothing wrong with them.

It's part of the reason why people meditate briefly, fail to see the value in it, then never meditate again.

Without realising that it's because they never fully understood how to meditate correctly, nor with the right mindset.

Which is cool, because I was also in that camp. 

However, as a result it also delayed my porn addiction recovery by a good 5 years and perhaps if I had been taught differently, I would have recovered much, much sooner. 

So with all this in mind, what is the biggest mistake that porn addicts make in regards to their porn addiction recovery?
