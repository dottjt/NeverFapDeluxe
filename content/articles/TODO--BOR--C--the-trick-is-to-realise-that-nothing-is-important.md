I just thought I'd take the time today to share a cool trick I've learnt over the years in regards to helping us overcoming difficult situations.

Often, the solution in most cases is to let go, and part of what makes these situations difficult isn't necessarily the situations themselves.

But due to our inability to respond appropriately, most certainly due to the self-limiting beliefs we have about ourselves. 

In particular, our fear of letting go or the consequences of what might happen if we were to let go.

While self-limiting beliefs aren't dismantled overnight, there's a certain mindset which I find helps deal with these situations.

So does this mean?

Well, although it may seem like reckless advice, it's actually incredibly sound when you get into the logic of what it actually means. 

When you make the statement "nothing is important" you're actually making a very essential claim about yourself and the situation. 

Primarily, that nothing is ever important enough to self-harm or do harm.

You see, the problem in most cases when we're irrational or feeling urges is that we develop this desire to react in some way. 

In a lot of cases it's merely instinctual. We feel awful. We feel obliged to do something about it, only to end up relapsing or doing something harmful like eat an entire bag of chips.

In fact, that's part of the core tennant of what NeverFap Deluxe is all about, learning to remain calm and composed inspite of what you're feeling.

To go into more detail, essentially 5% of our time should be spent practicing awareness via meditation and other exercises, while the other 95% of our time should be spent remaining calm.



<!-- OBLIGATION ARTICLE  -->

Furthermore, the sooner you realise that you have no obligation, the sooner you'll be able to act more effectively in your won lives. 

A key thing to note about obligation is that it is merely a feeling.

What it is, how we relate to it and how we use it to distort our ability to behave and act.
 

Unlike responsibility, obligation
