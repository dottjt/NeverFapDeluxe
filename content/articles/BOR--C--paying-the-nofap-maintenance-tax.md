What exactly is the NeverFap Maintenance Tax?

Well, aside from the fact that it's a term I've more-or-less made up on the spot, the NeverFap Maintenance Tax refers to the time and effort required in order to maintain our physical and mental health. 

It includes things like meditation, exercising, relaxing, studying, meditating, eating and brushing our teeth. 

Everything that helps us keep regular. 

The reason why I call it a tax is because many of us have the attitude that maintaining these things is simply unnecessary.

In fact, most of us can tend to view these things as a burden (usually due to the amount of time associated with actually doing them), despite the positive benefits they provide.

So what ends ups happening is that become selective about what we view as necessary or not. 

Maybe we don’t exercise, because we’d rather be studying or playing video games. Maybe we work or study too hard, because we don’t see the value in meditating or relaxing.

And what’s really disturbing, is how utterly unaware we are of how much we compromise in terms of our ability to function, often without truly being aware of it.

Certainly, I’ve been there.

And only now in retrospect do I realise how I was making something like giving up porn addiction almost impossible due to my own negative attitudes towards self-care.


{{< hr2 "In other words, if you’re struggling with your porn addiction it may be because you’re not paying your maintenance tax in full." >}}


In order to demonstrate this, I’m first going to talk about where I personally was making those compromises in my life.

And then explain the effect it was having on my ability to cope. 

As well as what successfully paying the maintenance tax actually entails.


{{< hr3 "Facing the consequences of imbalance" >}}


Prior to this realisation, I was under the impression that I was relatively functional and healthy. 

I was exercising three times a week. I was eating healthily. I was in a fantastic relationship. I was incredibly passionate about studying and I was full of ambition, ready to take on the world. 

On the other hand, there were other aspects of my life that were severely imbalanced. 

Aside from being severely addicted to porn, I was beginning to suffer from anxiety attacks from my excessive studying.

I was studying so much that it used to induce these kinds of 'coding nightmares' where I would be mentally coding in my sleep, but stuck in an indefinite loop where I would just write the same code again and again and again. 

It was truly awful.

My problem was that I was pushing myself too hard and I didn’t provide myself with the opportunity to relax.

All because I didn't view relaxation as a form of maintenance, in part because I was so obsessed with being productive and not falling behind.

Of course, you may have an opposite problem. You may not be motivated enough.

Everyone is different in this regard.

Once I'd respected this howeveri

{{< hr2 "Change in attitude" >}}


Embracing self-care requires a change in attitude. 

Instead of thinking about our immediate wants, we need to begin thinking holistically and understand that cutting corners of any kind, is going to result in future pain. 

It's going to cost us time in the long run. It's going to cost us emotional stability in the long run. Which exponentially increases the difficulty of everything else we hope to achieve. 

Only by paying the maintanence tax can we 

The key takeaway from this article is that self-care exists above all and that self-care is not optional. From now on, it is a hard requirement. By avoiding self-care, we delay the inevitable.

So after all this, you're probably wondering what an optimal self-care routine is? 

Well, I suppose a good place to start is with what I personally do on a daily/weekly basis. From there, I can extrapolate upon which aspects I believe are most important.

<hr class="hrul"/>

- I eat paleo.
- I do cardio and lift weights three times a week.
- I have a consistent sleep routine.
- I work on my hobbies and ambitions in my spare time.
- I play video games and watch TV to relax.
- I meditate approximately three times a day.
- I work a typical nine-to-five job.
- I brush my teeth in the morning and at night.
- I have a cold shower every night.

<hr class="hrul__bottom"/>

These are the things that I do on a daily basis which keep me regular.

Now an interesting thing to note is that realistically, in terms of achieving NeverFap, you don't need to do most of those things. In fact, I was personally doing most of those things while still being a pornography addict. 

In fact, it wasn't until I began adding meditation to my routine that I was finally able to overcome my porn addiction. 

So it's quite possible that all you need to do to overcome porn addiction is to learn to control your mind through meditation.
