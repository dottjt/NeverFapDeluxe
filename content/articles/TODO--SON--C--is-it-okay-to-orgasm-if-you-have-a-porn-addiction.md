You may be wondering:


{{< hr3 "\"Is it okay to orgasm if you have a porn addiction?\"" >}}


Whenever asking these kinds of questions, it can always help to come back to The Five Principles Of NeverFap.

In this particular case, this question primarily relates to <u>Struggle over none</u> and how orgasming affects our ability to overcome porn addiction.

For starters, I want to begin by saying that I personally don't orgasm, and that I haven't pursued orgasmed since effectively overcoming my porn addiction.

I've even taught myself not to orgasm during sex, so it's certainly not an issue there. 

Essentially the reason why I don't orgasm is quite simple.


{{< hr4 "The act of orgasming still messes with your emotions." >}}


At the end of the day, I don't particularly care about the philosophical, nor even the moral arguments behind why you shouldn't watch porn. 

Ultimately I'm a processes guy, which means I care solely about the easiest and most efficient way to achieve something.

Orgasming simply makes it harder to overcome porn addiction, whether to porn or not.

When you orgasm you still experience an intense dopamine rush which more-or-less makes regulating your emotions in a calm, uninhibited state impossible.


It's the same reason why you also shouldn't binge eat or fail to not following.

Orgasming, something which produces an excessive amount of dopamine, and therefore a dopamine lull - really is no different.

What <u>Struggle over none</u> describes is that everything we do should make overcoming our porn addiction easier. 

The thing to understand about fundamental principles is that it doesn't really care about the details.
