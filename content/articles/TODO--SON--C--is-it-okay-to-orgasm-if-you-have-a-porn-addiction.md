You may be wondering:


{{< hr3 "\"Is it okay to orgasm if you have a porn addiction?\"" >}}


Whenever asking these kinds of questions, it can always help to come back to The Five Principles Of NeverFap.

In this particular case, this question primarily relates to <u>Struggle over none</u> and how orgasming affects our ability to overcome porn addiction.

For starters, I want to begin by saying that I personally don't orgasm.

I have a healthy amount of sex, but I don't orgasm.

The reason why I don't orgasm is quite simple.


{{< hr4 "The act of orgasming makes it harder to regulate your emotions." >}}


At the end of the day, even if porn (and by association, orgasm) is the thing that you're addicted to, in no way does it make pursing other destabilising behaviours 'okay'.

It's the same reason why you also shouldn't binge eat or fail to not following.

Orgasming, something which produces an excessive amount of dopamine, and therefore a dopamine lull - really is no different.

What <u>Struggle over none</u> describes is that everything we do should make overcoming our porn addiction easier. 

The thing to understand about fundamental principles is that it doesn't really care about the details.
