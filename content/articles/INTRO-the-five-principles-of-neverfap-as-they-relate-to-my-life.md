  tldr1: "The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap have been devised from my own personal approach towards addressing porn addiction."

---

To be quite honest, the five principles are quite arbitrary.

Which is to say that they're nothing more than cheap slogans until you develop a personal understanding what they actually mean to your own life.

While my article <a class="link" href="/articles/the-five-fundamental-principles-of-neverfap">The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap</a> is a good introduction into what they are, today I want to talk about what they actually mean in my own everyday life.

Because theory is one thing, however actually describing the impact that theory has in everyday situations, is arguably going to be more meaningful than the theory itself. 

So here's why those fundamental principles are just so damn important.

And perhaps, you may relate.

  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">01 - Choice over mind</div></span>
</div>

Choice over mind reminds me that I'm always in control of myself.

It reminds me that I have the ability to control how I feel, control what I do, as well as control my reaction to what takes place in life. 

Essentially, it's a principle which gives me confidence over my porn addiction. 

It gives me the confidence to understand that no matter what, I decide how I deal with my relation to porn.

I understand that if I do struggle with porn, it's not because I've lost control (in part because it's not possible to lose control, as opposed to simply making a bad decision).

But rather, because I'm understanding some aspect of myself, which is causing me to struggle in some way.

Which is an amazing insight to have, because it also helps me not take my relationship with porn personally.

So in summary, Choice over mind gives me that vital "I've always got this" mentality. 

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">02 - Balance over reward</div></span>
</div>

Balance over reward is perhaps the one I personally struggle with most. 

I'm an entrepeneur of sorts who's rather obsessed with productivity. As a result, I tend to overwork myself and even worse, develop crushing mania.

In other words, I struggle with bipolar disorder, and let me tell you, it is almost impossible to overcome something like porn addiction when your emotions are completely out of whack on a constant cycle.

Yet, there is a solution. 

Essentially, by embracing balance as a fundamental principle, I've been able to avoid getting to a point of complete mania and obsession, and therefore not experience those highs and lows. 

What does this entail?

Obviously meditation helps significantly with helping me remain calm, however I would say the biggest thing that helps is simply realising when I need to stop working.

Previously, I would continue working and writing up until before I had to go to bed, which would result in sleepless nights and would even result in 'coding nightmares' which I'll have to explain at a later date. 

However, I can confirm they were awful. 

What usually happens now is that I will simply stop doing any work around an hour and a half before bed, and it works brilliantly.

Sometimes I may still slip into mania if I've been working particularly hard up until then, however the hour and a half is enough for me to calm down before bed. 

During that time which I stretch, meditate and generally, relax.

Initially it was really hard to stop myself from working. The very idea of forcing myself to play video games and not work was hilarious, but I knew that if I didn't relax, I'd face more pain later.

Now that I have this balance in my life, I have much more control over my emotions and my attitude towards productivity has changed. 

I now realise that I am more productive by being balanced, and that I have more control over my life as a result.

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">03 - Awareness over all</div></span>
</div>

I love being aware of my feelings and emotions. 

It's like having a super power where you can instantly recognise what is happening within your head at any moment in time.

I think of awareness as the big brother that helps keep me together. It's what helps ground me to the future decisions and actions I can make. 

It is that thing in my brain which allows me to choose a healthy coping mechanism instead of defaulting to watching porn. 

So that I am always in control, because it helps me always remain calm and not lose control.

Awareness help me with my porn addiction by allowing me to recognise behaviours and trends ahead of time, so I don't get stuck within them.

What this means for me is recognising what I should be paying attention to in different situations. 

If I'm on public transport and there are a lot of pretty women around, I remind myself that I just need to effortlessly relax and focus on my work.

If I'm feeling stressed, I remind myself to time out and go for a walk.

Awareness is one of those things that you develop both from meditation, but also simply applying simple observation to everyday situations.

Awareness is like a sedative that makes you more awake.

It is what helps me effortlessly cope. 

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">04 - Struggle over none</div></span>
</div>

Struggle over none is all about understanding that which we misunderstand.

It's about understanding that we do have choice over what happens in life, and that there's no reason what-so-ever to take it personally if we feel as if we don't.

In other words, it's about having empathy for yourself.

We all have periods where we struggle. 

We may be struggling with how to deal with other people. We may be struggling with a difficult problem we've been tasked to solve. We may be struggling with our emotions and how to address them. 

This principle is here to remind you: "That's totally okay. There's no reason to react. I fully accept what I'm feeling as merely a by-product of misunderstanding, and there's nothing necessarily wrong with these negative feelings."

In the past, I would usually try to fight back.

I wouldn't recognise my struggle as a misunderstanding, and instead I would assume it was because I wasn't trying hard enough, or because my emotions were becoming unmanagable.

Which would obviously make everything worse, eventually leading to relapse in some form. 

Now anytime I struggle, I actually feel rather calm on some level.

I embrace and recognise those emotions as something different and I relax into them. I don't take them personally, and I thank them for explaining to me that I'm personally doing something incorrect which is causing this. 

After all, it's really hard to take something personally and react when you accept and acknowledge something for what it is.


<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">05 - Uncondition over judgement</div></span>
</div>

This is the principle most porn addicts generally struggle with initially, once they realise that they have a porn problem.

Of course, it's not a problem that's specific to porn addiction itself, however one which is an overarching problem within itself. 

In a sense, this principle is sort of the opposite to Awareness over all. 

Because what judgements essentially do is take power away from your ability to be aware. 

It's impossible to observe and be aware of what is taking place in our mind, if your mind is focusing on constantly creating thoughts and describing reality.

Certainly, I used to be a very judgemental person, often in ways we don't realise are judgemental.

For example, I used to incessantly scan women in public, trying to find attractive ones to obsess over. 

Overtime I've learnt not to judge at all, simply because I realise is serves no purpose in regards to cultivating my mental health.

Again, through meditation.
