A lot of people ask me something along the lines of:

{{< hr3 "\"How do I know when I'm fully recovered from my porn addiction?\"" >}}

Well, believe it or not, there actually is a very comprehensive way to know whether you've fully recovered or not.

Put simply, you've fully recovered once you have full confidence in your ability to overcome your porn addiction.

Which is to say that if you are 100% certain that you know absolutely everything you need to know in order to overcome your porn addiction, in order to deal with every possible situation without relapsing.

Then you'll never relapse again.

On the other hand, if you have even the slightest doubt about any possible situation which you believe may unravel you, then you are not recovered.

And really, coming to understand what it means to be "fully recovered" within this context is super important, because it also tests what we know about ourselves.


{{< hr3 "Of course, the problem is that what we know about ourselves is often incorrect.">}}


So although we may feel certain at times, this isn't to say that we truly understand ourselves, let alone are truly certain in any way. 

In essence, what I'm trying to say is that a large part of your porn addiction recovery comes down to rediscovering this idea of "certainty" and what it actually means.

What does certainty entail? Is certainty purely emotional? Is certainty a process? How can I guarantee certainty 1 week from now, let alone within 3 months' time?

If you don't have 100% confidence in the answers you have to these questions, then you don't truly understand certainty.

And that's fine, because ultimately this is a process of self-discovery.

There are no cheap hacks or quicks ways of getting around this. The only way to achieve a high level of certainty, is to practice meditation and awareness exercises each and everyday. 

In order to slowly dissect this puzzle I'm sure you've been trying to figure out for a while.

Ultimately, there's no point in having me telling you what I think certainty is, because it entirely defeats the purpose of what we're trying to achieve here.

Reading about it is simply not enough.

As an extension of this discussion, the problem most of us face as porn addicts is that we're delusional.

Often we'll think we have it down, when we clearly haven't and at times we'll also become really depressed and hopeless about our recovery, even though there'll be no reason to be at all.

Which is also to say that this concept of "certainty" is a funny one.

Essentially the point I'm trying to make is that your concept of certainty is almost always incorrect, and furthermore, limited by what you currently know.

Thankfully, there's a way around this. 

You see, certainty comes in many forms. There is 'knowing' something and then there is 'doing' something. 

If you're 100% certain that you'll always 'do' that something then you'll be golden.


{{< hr3 "Personally speaking, I knew I was recovered from the moment that I discovered proper meditation technique.">}}


Because from that moment, I knew I had all the skills necessary in order to be able to deal with whatever emotions and feelings life threw at me. 

That's when I'd mentally achieved "certainty".

And within that moment, it all became quite clear in my own mind and I've proven myself correct ever since. 

In essence, although overcoming porn addiction may seem like a game of confidence, this is merely a symptom of the real cause which is skill.

When you have a high degree of skill, because you've been practicing meditation and awareness execrices everyday, it provides you with the confidence to be able to approach your porn addiction recovery with absolute certainty.
