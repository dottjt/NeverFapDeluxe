The NeverFap method of addressing porn addiction comprises of five core principles. 

Each principle maintains a purpose, along with a range of associated skills which you must develop in order to successfully address your porn addiction.

Without mastery of all five of these principles, we cannot hope to consistently manage the emotions, thoughts and  behaviours which may be contributing towards our porn addiction.

Before we begin however, we must ask ourselves a very important question: 

<hr class="hr3"/>

### What is a fundamental principle and what makes it fundamental?

<hr class="hr3"/>

A fundamental principle is a hard truth. It is something which remains true irrespective of whether you agree with it, how you feel about it, nor even how you understand or interpret it.

It simply is.

You may attempt to dispute these fundamental truths or argue against their validity, which is perfectly fine if that is what you want to do.

However it certainly won't help you overcome porn addiction, which is probably the reason why you're here.

You know, to receive help with a problem that you fundamentally misunderstand, for otherwise you wouldn't have a problem to begin with.

<hr class="hr2"/>

## Keeping Your Mind In Check

<hr class="hr2"/>

The key thing to understand about fundamental principles is that they are not subject to open-ended thinking.

Thinking such as:

<hr class="hrul"/>

**"Well, my mind doesn't work like that"**

**"While that may be true, I don't personally allow it to affect me in any way".**

<hr class="hrul"/>

This is not how fundamental principles operate. 

Hard truths are not open to subjective questioning. Certainly, you're more than welcome to question them if you like, however it won't help you with your porn addiction.

In fact, there's a word used to describe when we refuse to accept reality.

<hr class="hr3"/>

### This word is called denial.

<hr class="hr3"/>

Whether you realise it or not, the reason why you are a porn addict is because you are in denial about some aspect of your life, which is causing you to misunderstand yourself and result in your current obsession with porn.

Ultimately, the aim of these five fundamental principles is to help you expose the fact that there is something wrong with the way you currently think.

As a former porn addict, I encourage you to embrace the idea that everything you know about yourself is wrong, and to not fight the unfamiliar.

You cannot get better if you cannot first recognise that you have a problem. 

<hr class="hr2"/>

## The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap

<hr class="hr2"/>

On a superficial level, none of these principles seem to have anything to do with addressing porn addiction. 

For example, there are no fundamental NeverFap principles along the lines of "Never visit a porn website ever again" or "Limit orgasming to sex only".

A large part of the reason why this is the case is because porn addiction has very little to do with porn, nor even masturbation itself. 

Rather, porn addiction is merely a symptom of a wider range of personality traits which NeverFap aims to address.

So without further ado, here are the five fundmental principles of NeverFap: 

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">01 - Choice over mind</div></span>
</div>

While all these principles are important in their own right, this is perhaps the one that people tend to struggle with most.

Or rather, it is a way of thinking and understanding which is completely foreign to most of us, and even those of us who do not have a porn addiction.

What <u>*Choice over mind*</u> iterates is the fact that you have complete control over your mind.

This is irrespective of whether you currently feel in control of your mind, whether you agree it's possible to have full control over your mind, or even if you've never experienced being full control over your mind. 

Your mind is fundamentally capable of being controlled.

I would say this fundamental principle is both equal parts understanding, as it is practice.

And the way this is achieved is through controlled meditation and perspective training.

For example, many porn addicts (particularly male porn addicts) have a tendency to stare at women they find attractive in public. 

It's something porn addicts (as well as men in general) struggle with because they feel as if they don't have a choice but to stare. 

Well, this simply is not true. 

With daily practice, we can learn to develop control over our mind, and we can learn to completely filter out women in public altogether.

Now imagine how awesome that would be?

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">02 - Balance over reward</div></span>
</div>

This is one of those concepts that people think they understand, and yet refutely misunderstand, because of how oblivious they are to how unbalanced they really are to begin with.

In fact, it's something most people outright ignore because they don't believe it's that big of a deal, not quite understanding the consequences of their actions.

<hr class="hr3"/>

### Which again, is behaviour which can only be described as denial.

<hr class="hr3"/>

What <u>*Balance over reward*</u> maintains is this idea that we must prioritise balance over our immediate wants and goals.

Often when we become affixated with something, either through obsession or neglect, we fail to consider the wider ramifications of our actions.

So we cut corners in order to achieve or experience what we want, only to face the consequences of our actions later. 

Often not realising that the reason why we're struggling is because of the corners that we've cut. 

Overworking is a prominent example of disrespecting this fundamental principle. 

We stay up late to finish what we're working on, only to find ourselves struggling to fall asleep because our minds are so preoccupied with work. 

I even used to get coding nightmares because of how much time I would spend writing code.

And yet, I didn't quite realise that I was necessarily doing anything wrong, because I felt justified in my actions. Even though a) It made me less productive overall than if I were functioning normally and b) Engaged my desire to watch porn due to all the stress it was causing me.

Instead, by learning to respect balance in my life, I've been able to live my life more effectively, without the constant emotional volatility and stress.

I think part of the problem is that people fall into the trap of believing they're inherently unique when it comes to certain aspects of life.

<hr class="hr3"/>

### They think they can somehow "cheat" the system and come out ahead.

<hr class="hr3"/>

When it's both physically and mentally impossible to do so. 

The point is that if we are to overcome our porn addiction, we must begin to not only understand that there are hard consequences to everything we do, but also that immediate rewards are often a poor indicator of what is best for us long term.

And learning to value and respect these boundaries, will pay you dividends in the amount of control you will gain over your porn addiction, as well as your life in general.


<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">03 - Awareness over all</div></span>
</div>

Awareness is absolutely fundamental to everything we do.

It is what allows us to identify and address the destructive patterns in our life, as well as serve as a stop-gap between our thoughts and our actions.

What <u>*Awareness over all*</u> maintains is that having awareness over our actions is critical to not only understanding them, but also learning to control them.

Without full awareness, we simply cannot hope to act with any amount of intention, nor understand the responsibility we have over them.

Instead, we allow our habitual thoughts, emotions and beliefs to take over and continue their self-destructive patterns.

I think the reason why most people struggle with this concept of awareness is because a) They're not currently aware, nor understand how to be aware because it's not something they've ever practiced and b) Most people struggle to even undesrtand what awareness actually is. 

In reality, awareness is actually really simple.

<hr class="hr3"/>

### Awareness is nothing more than your ability to sense the world around you. 

<hr class="hr3"/>

That's literally it.

In fact, all meditation essentially comes down to sitting there, and just following your senses.

It's not about focusing or about trying really hard not to think or even empty your mind (although these things can definitely be useful). 

It's simply about being present with our senses.

Which of course, we can expand to developing our focus and empty our mind. 


<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">04 - Struggle over none</div></span>
</div>

Essentially, the simplest path is often the most efficient.

And as humans, we instinctly do what we find most simple, either for better or worse.

Therefore, solutions which are simple by design are going to be more effective than solutions which are convoluted.

It's the reason why I personally follow the paleo diet and only eat one meal a day. 

Doing this is vastly more simple than counting calories, obsessing over when I can eat and organising three meals a day.

In other words, simple is often easy. 

What <u>*Struggle over none*</u> relates to is this idea that if you're really struggling with someone, then you're probably not doing it right.

Which means either you're not understanding it intuitively (making it simple), or what you're trying to understand is convoluted.  

Understand that porn recovery isn't about fighting your emotions or violently pushing yourself to become something you're not.

<hr class="hr3"/>

### It's about understanding who you are so that you no longer need to fight yourself on a daily basis. 

<hr class="hr3"/>

Because life without porn isn't a struggle.

It's one of the most liberating and empowering things you can do.

The only reason why you're a porn addict is because you're constantly fighting yourself in some regard.

The takeaway is that life only becomes a chore when we act against it or neglect it. 

Target the root cause of this misunderstanding and all those negative feelings and emotions will literally melt away.

<div style="margin-top: 3rem;" class="five__principles__list__page">
  <span><div class="five__principles__item__page">05 - Uncondition over </div></span>
</div>

Much like Balance over reward, this is one of those principles that people tend to ignore, because they don't quite understand the ramifications of ignoring it.

<u>Uncondition over judgement</u> is about pursing acceptance over judgement under all circumstances.

What a lot of people don't realise is that judgement is a mental trap.

Because when you make a judgement, you essentially trap yourself into a limited point of view. 

The reason why it doesn't seem like a trap is because they don't realise that the negative effects of making judgements is accumulative.

Making one judgement isn't going to kill you. But humans never just make one judgement.

We make thousands of judgements each and every day, each time moulding our perception and changing the way we think.

Judgements are not harmless. 

Not only do you exchange your awareness when you make a judgement, however you also place your faith into that idea as well.

It is a destructive habit that feeds into itself. 

The more judgements you make, the more awareness you trade, the more faith that gets placed into ideas you may not even have cared about initially, and it becomes this trap that people become oblivious to. 

Because guess what happens when you invest all your faith in a bunch of pointless ideas?

You have none left to address actual problems in your life, like your porn addiction. 

<hr/>

Hopefully you have a better idea of what the Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap are, as well as what they represent.

They exist to help guide you through your porn recovery journey, and help you make healthy decisions.

If ever you get confused about anything, it can help to come back to these five principles and try to assess what you might be doing incorrectly.

Because at the end of the day it is not impossible to overcome porn addiction.

You just have to know exactly what you're doing and why.
