People seem to be interested in what The Reade is up to, so I thought I might share my meditation routine with people.

Essentially, I keep it simple.

I meditate 10 minutes before bed each night, and that's really all there is to it.

Furthermore, that's all people really need.

If I had to recommend more meditation, I would say it's more effective to do short sessions, than long ones.
