People seem to be interested in what The Reade&copy; is up to, so I thought I might share my meditation routine with people.

Essentially, I keep it simple.

Furthermore, that's all we really need.

People seem to overcomplicate this whole idea of meditation, and in particular mindfulness, thinking that it's supposed to be this thing we do for 40 minutes each day in order for it to be effective. 

However, I would say that largely defeats the purpose what we're trying to achieve with meditation.

Meditation isn't like physical exercise where the longer you do it, and the more intense your session, the more you'll gain from it.

Instead, meditation can be much more benefitial if you view it as a balancer of sorts, no different to drinking water throughout the day.

Essentially what meditation does is that it grounds you back to your present self, and so doing this frequently throughout the day is more useful than trying to push through longer sessions. 


Essentially there are two things which meditation helps us to 

If I had to recommend more meditation, I would say it's more effective to do short sessions, than long ones.
