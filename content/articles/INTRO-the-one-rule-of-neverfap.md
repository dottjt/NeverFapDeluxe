Let's discuss a NeverFap best case scenario.

Here are a list of metrics that reflect a very healthy attitude towards life and porn addiction.

<hr/>

- You no longer watch porn.
- You no longer crave watching porn.
- Pornography isn’t something you ever think about, at all. 
- You no longer stare at women in public. You don’t even notice them.
- You see women as other human beings, no more special than you.
- You no longer judge other human beings, including yourself. 
- You have control over your mind and thoughts. 
- You’re conscious of your feelings and emotions. 
- You’re happy with yourself and accept every single aspect of who you are.
- You’re comfortable with your emotions, both positive and negative. 
- You’re confident because you understand yourself. 
- You don’t engage in self-harm of any kind.
- You’re motivated and ambitious.
- You’re committed to your mental health.

<hr/>

Fancy pants.

Go out there and buy yourself a Golden Globe. Now that you fully understand what you must achieve, you absolutely deserve it.

<hr/>

### If it weren't for the fact that lists like these are utterly meaningless.

<hr/>

Here's the deal, soldier.

We're going to try something a little different here at NeverFap. 

Rather than concern ourselves with goals and ideals, what we're going to do is instead is focus on processes and practices.

This is something I talk about extensively in my <a class="link" href="/guide/why-am-I-a-porn-addict">"Why Am I A Porn Addict?"</a> article.

<hr/>

### What we're going to do is focus on the things we can do everyday in order to improve as a person. 

<hr/>

Because at the end of the day, there really is no such thing as an 'ideal outcome' or a 'best case scenario' when it comes to addressing porn addiction.

And even if there possibly were, it's not a healthy, nor particularly empowering way to look things. 

Instead there is only you and the improvements that you make each and every single day.

What's we're interested in is movement, not ideas.

Movement is what gets us to our destination, not describing the destination itself.

That is why much of the content on this website is built around verifiable practices, so that you can actively improve and make changes to your life on a daily basis.

So let's keep it simple:

<hr/>

### The only rule of NeverFap is that you practice everyday.

<hr/>

Everything else is just noise.

Sure, you probably feel good that you can count the number of days since your last relapse on two hands. 

But what on earth does this actually have to do with porn recovery? How is comparing yourself to a past failure going to help you become a better person today?

On the otherhand, concerning yourself with what you personally did that day to improve your ability to focus, is wonderful.

The primary reason why it's wonderful is because it builds your awareness of the things you did right, which helps you make correct decisions in the future.

This is why it's important to journal your efforts and note down which practices you did that day, so you can acknowledge what you achieved and how it made you feel.

Remember.

Practice. Practice. Practice.

<hr/>

### Consistent hard work and practice are the only ideals which you should strive towards. 

<hr/>

Everything else is pure fluff, no matter how impressive it may sound in a list of glorified achievements.

Because I can assure you that I don't live my life according to a list of ideals that my brain constantly surveils.

Instead, I follow fundamental principles. I work towards them on a daily basis. I experience the improvements in real-time.

And seemingly, everything just appears to work and come together.

That my friends, is the magic of hard work and simplicity.
