<!-- Will probably need edit/revise -->


<!-- So, it should probably come here then. -->

There's one excuse that I often see porn addicts come up with in regards to their addiction. 


{{< hr3 "I don't have enough time." >}}


It's an attitude which ironically, prevents us from actually focusing on what's important in life.

So how does it start?

Some say the reason why we feel as if we do not have enough time is because we as humans have been sold on this idea that we must be 'productive' with our time.

Even if it's only the mere feeling of productivity. 

For example, checking our phone every five minutes to see if someone's messaged us over Facebook.

Perhaps we're just too obsessed with our goals and ambitions in life, to a point where we feel obliged to maintain routine. 


{{< hr3 "No matter how you choose to interpret it, I'm here to tell you that it's a disorder." >}}


It is a disorder because it's a choice to neglect one's mental health, and there are never any valid reasons why anyone should ever neglect their mental health.

Your mental health is sacred. 

It is the most important thing you have. It is what allows you to experience the world without suffering.

The moment you compromise on your mental health is when you introduce the potential to suffer. 

Of course, with this disorder, time is instead believed to be the most sacred thing of all. 


{{< hr4 "So a question I ask those people is, what is time without your mental health?" >}}


Without mental health, time becomes an uncontrollable struggle of judgement, self-criticism and depression. 

Without mental health, time is spent fulfiling addiction, along with all the feelings of helplessness of despair that come with it. 

Without mental health, days seem like years in situations we may grow to despise, such as our jobs. 

Without mental health, time becomes a infinite struggle without end.


{{< hr4 "Of course, there's a reason why bad mental health is often described as a self-repeating cycle." >}}


We choose to obsess over something which we believe will make us happy i.e. addiction, uncheked ambitions etc.

We worship that activity with our effort and time, believing it will make us feel better about ourselves.

We end up feeling empty once the obsession wears off, inspite of all the time we spent believing in this solutions.

Then we go and repeat the cycle again and again and again. 


{{< hr3 "To be honest, it's a bit shit." >}}


And I'm sure you know it too.

All because we don't believe we have enough 'time' to actually commit to something which will actually make us happy. 

Certainly, I don't blame people.

It's hard when your emotions are out of whack, and you genuinely believe that "this time will be different".

It's hard when you've got nothing left to lose because you're so emotionally empty that you don't really care what happens next.


{{< hr4 "But there's never a bad time to commit to your mental health." >}}


One key thing to understand about mental health is that it's accumulative.

And the true beauty of mental health is that it doesn't work the way like obsession or addiction does. 

Which is to say that you don't achieve good mental health by spending five hours a day meditating in an attempt to undo years of self-harm.

That's not how it works at all. 

The way mental health works is by commiting a bit of your time each day towards.


{{< hr3 "Honestly, spending ten minutes at night before bed meditating is all most people need." >}}


Although I'd like to take it one step further.

<u>It's about focusing on what you can do today.</u>

This is the key to breaking this habit of never committing to your mental health.

Realising that mental health isn't achieved by what you don't do, but rather by what you can do today. 

Ultimately, however.


{{< hr3 "If you don't truly believe or understand that your mental health is more important than anything else in your life." >}}


Then you're going to continue to pursue activities which will conflict with your mental health.

Just remember that whatever other things you achieve in place of your mental health, they will never even come close to being in a good place mentally.

Which is to say that they will always be compromises, rather than true solutions to your problems.

Compromises which will always leave you hanging for more, only to repeat the same cycles again, and again and again.


{{< hr4  "From this point of view, you have nothing to gain from neglecting your mental health." >}}


No matter what other benefits those other achievements may provide.

Because in the overall scheme of things, your mental health is what determines how you feel, not your achievements.

As much as you would like to believe otherwise. 

So in the overall scheme of things, 10 minutes, or even an hour a day spent working on your mental health is miniscule, compared to the benefits it provides.

You decide.
