## Week 3 - Relax Everything

Welcome to Week 3 of the 7 Week Awareness Challenge Vol 1.

This week we are going to be focusing our attention

## Script


<!-- INTRO -->

Hello, and welcome to Week 3 of volume 1 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

In this exercise what we are going to do is actively focus on this idea of remaining completely relaxed.

And I mean, completely relaxed. 

Because ultimately, no different to being focused, or even grateful, being relaxed a skill which we can develop through practice. And that's essentially what we're going to be doing today with this exercise.

<!-- CONTEXT -->

Chances are, if you are the kind of person who struggles to relax, then fundamentally speaking it probably means that you have a very difficult time letting go of things.

It could be on an emotional level, for example, feeling upset because of something someone said to you, and not knowing how to simply accept it and move on.

On the other hand, you might struggle to let go on a more conceptual level. For example, you might struggle to let go of a particular thought or worry you may have, even though part of you knows that these thoughts are a silly thing to hold onto. 

For a lot of people, this includes worrying about how others perceive them, and this is such a huge issue because it's really hard to be relaxed when you are feeling insecure about yourself, and you are still holding to that idea or belief that you aren't good enough, or whatever that might be.

So in order to partly change how we feel about ourselves, for a moment we are going to focus in on ourselves. 

And if you have been meditating regularly as you should be as part of your daily routine, then you'll notice that 



Think of it in terms of stages.
