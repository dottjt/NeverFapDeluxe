## Week 6 - Can You Look Through Walls?

Welcome to Week 6 of the 7 Week Awareness Challenge Vol 1.

This week we are going to be focusing our attention

## Script

<!-- INTRO -->

Hello, and welcome to Week 6 of volume 1 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

Let me tell you, this is a really fun exercise that allows people to be both creative and mindful at the same time.

I think the reason why it's fun actually has a lot less to do with the creativity of the exercise, and more to do with the fact that it doesn't inherently set any expectations


<!-- EXERCISE -->

What we are going to do with this exercise is that we are going to pretend as if we can look through walls.

Not just pretend, but also to completely imagine an exciting, new world beyond these walls.



So what exactly is the point of doing this?

Part of what we are doing is exploring a conceptual extension of our senses, in particular instance, our sight. 

Not only can it help us learn more about our existing senses, however it can also help us develop better control over our minds and our ability to conceptualise foreign concepts.
