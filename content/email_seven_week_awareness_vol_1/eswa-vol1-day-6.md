## Week 6 - Can You Look Through Walls?

Welcome to Week 6 of the 7 Week Awareness Challenge Vol 1.

This week we are going to be practicing an exercise called Can You Look Through Walls? which is a perspective exercise designed to help you think beyond your own senses.

Using our imagination in this way is an important part of learning to think consciously, which along with remaining calm and aware, is a primary skill we must learn if we're going to effectively address urges etc.

Have fun with this one, because it really is a great exercise that allows you to express yourself in creative ways.

For further information on this practice, please visit the Can You Look Through Walls? page on the website.

## Script

<!-- INTRO -->

Hello, and welcome to Week 6 of volume 1 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

Let me tell you, this is a really fun exercise that allows people to be both creative and mindful at the same time.

I think the reason why it's fun actually has a lot less to do with the creativity of the exercise, and more to do with the fact that it doesn't inherently set any expectations


<!-- EXERCISE -->

What we are going to do with this exercise is that we are going to pretend as if we can look through walls.

Not just pretend, but also to completely imagine an exciting, new world beyond these walls.



So what exactly is the point of doing this?

Part of what we are doing is exploring a conceptual extension of our senses, in particular instance, our sight. 

Not only can it help us learn more about our existing senses, however it can also help us develop better control over our minds and our ability to conceptualise foreign concepts.
