## Script


Hello, and welcome to Week 2 of volume 1 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

What we are going to do today is practice a very particular perspective exercise which is designed to help us shift our perspective in a very sudden and abrupt way.

<!-- CONTEXT -->

Before we explore this exercise, let's talk a little bit about perspective and in particular, what is perspective?

Perspective can essentially be summed up as looking at the same thing from different points of view. So that's really the skill we will be developing with this exercise.

And it's such an important skill because let's say we're in the middle of experiencing an intense urge to watch porn.

Where in fact it's gotten to a point where we cannot concencrate, or even think about anything else other than porn. 

Well, the reason why we get this point is because we become so entrenched and stuck within this particular point of view, that we simply don't know how to step outside of this perspective and instead realise that there are other points of view where we can feel empowered and free instead.

Now if you have been diligently studying NeverFap Deluxe, you would know that the way you do this, as in break out of the perspective of feeling as if you must watch porn, is by actually remaining calm and letting go of our feelings so you are completely at ease, and there is no opporunity for you to desire porn because you're so calm and relaxed that there simply isn't even the opportunity to do so.

But, the only way that you are going to be able to experience that, is if you are able to have that perspective shift where you are first able to recognise that there even is an alternative, and then act on that alternative. 

As I'm sure you are aware, what usually ends up happening is that people will continue to become affixated with those thoughts until they eventually give in, and obviously that's when everything falls apart. 

So by practicing this exercise, you can provide yourself with an opportunity to take a different path when faced with challenging circumstances.

<!-- EXERCISE -->

So to explain how to practice this exercise, essentially what you are going to do is find yourself an object in the distance for you to serve as a reference point. For example, it could be a tree that you see outside, or maybe something faraway on the wall opposite you. Certainly, although it's possible to practice this exercise while using an object within your room, it generally works a lot better with things that are, let's say, more than 10 metres away.

And once you've found this object, I want you to face it. And once you are facing it, I want you to focus your attention solely on this object. I want you to look at it. Notice it's presence. 

Now I want you to place one of your fingers in front of your face, not too close, but close enough that you're able to see clearly without too much difficulty. I want you to focus your attention on that finger.


So what does this exercise teach us? Well, it teaches us that our point of view in any particular moment is not solid. 




It's a very effective because it's actually super simple to do anywhere, 



focus our attention in particular ways, in order to help us better understand this idea of attention, and how it can dramatically change how we think about ourselves and situations.


What we want to do as well throughout the day, is to ask ourselves, what perspective am I looking at things from and in addition, asking ourselves how that perspective makes us feel.
