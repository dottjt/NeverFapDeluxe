## Week 2 - Focus On Your Finger And Your Background

Welcome to Week 2 of the 7 Week Awareness Challenge Vol 1.

This week we are going to be focusing our attention

## Script


Hello, and welcome to Week 2 of volume 1 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

In this exercise what we are going to do is focus our attention in particular ways, in order to help us better understand this idea of attention, and how it can dramatically change how we think about ourselves and situations.

I really like this exercise because it has quite a profound and immediate effect for a lot of people
