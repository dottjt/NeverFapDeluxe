Hello, and welcome to Week 5 of volume 1 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

Part of what makes this exercise so powerful, is because of how practical it actually is in terms of solidifying this idea of how we should be practicing awareness in our daily lives.

The basic idea is that we as humans should aim to be as aware as possible throughout the day. Which is to say that we are present with ourselves, that we are calm and our minds aren't particularly distracted.

Because as I'm sure you're aware, once you lose that awareness, it's basically game over. You start to get bored. You no longer feel motivated. 

And the funny is that, this is something we actually treat as being quite normal.

For example we will be studying for a few hours, and then we'll hit a point where we feel as if we simply cannot study anymore. Like, as if our mind has actually physically shut off on some level.

Well, the real reason for this is because at some point you actually lost your capacity for conscious awareness

So that's in part what this exercise is here to help you achieve, which is to remain aware by consciously identifying key points throughout the day.
