## Week 4 - Slow Down Time

Welcome to Week 4 of the 7 Week Awareness Challenge Vol 1.

This week we are going to be focusing our attention

## Script

<!-- INTRO -->

Hello, and welcome to Week 4 of volume 1 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

In this exercise what we are going to do is change the way that we think about time, so we can learn to become more in-control of ourselves.

Largely what this exercise centers around is manipulating our perception of priority. Priority obviously refers to that which is most important in our lives. 

<!-- CONTEXT -->

For example, it's important that we prioritise our mental health, otherwise we can find ourselves in a position where we have lost balance in some way, which causes all sorts of knock on effects.

The reason why we are targeting priority in this exercise is because for a lot of people, there is actually a great deal of fear and resistance when it comes to actually committing to things which we believe are priority. 

It could be study. It could your own mental health. It could be exercise. All things which we may know we need to do, but also struggle to commit to in any meaningful way.

And when you have this resistance, it creates all sorts of depression, anxiety and fear, to a point where even thinking about committing can make us feel uneasy. 

Well, the reason for this is because we simply don't practice the art of prioritising itself, in any meaningful way. 

The problem with a lot of human endeavour is that we know on some fundamental level what it is we need to do, but very rarely do we ever know how to actually get there.

Ultimately this exercise is here to teach you that "actually get there" part, which is so much more important than simply knowing that everything is not okay.

<!-- EXERCISE -->

And the way we are going to do this is by fundamentally introducing our own priority. 

What does this mean? Well, it means a couple of things actually, which will help you better understand what priority actually means. 

Priority itself is actually just a condition. It's a condition we create, which says that one thing is more important than another.

And the way we are going to achieve this is with time.

The reason why we are using time is because time is something which, at least in the western world, is perceieved to be inherently important within itself.

So by placing a condition on time itself,
