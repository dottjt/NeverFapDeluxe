## Script

Hello, and welcome to Week 4 of Volume 4 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

For this exercise what we are going to do is commit ourselves into a very regular routine of awareness, where every 30 minutes or so, we must decidedly become aware of what we are doing within that moment.

<!-- CONTEXT -->

Now, the reason for this exercise is that this is ultimately what you should be doing everyday anyway. Part of what makes NeverFap Deluxe so effective is that it is designed to make you highly aware of yourself at all times, which is to say that you are also calm as well. Aware and calm - the two tennants of an effective, balanced mind.

Well what this exercise can help you with is to develop this habit in a very targeted way, by ensuring that we maintain our awareness by thinking about it at pre-determined moments throughout the day. 

Now here's the thing, while this exercise sounds relatively straightforward, it actually is incredibly difficult for people to do consistently, especially if it's not something that they've practiced before.

A lot of people will count the first few 30 minute blocks, and then completely forget to do it for the rest of the day. Or they simply won't be consistent with the time period and they will only remember to check every 2 hours or so.

And this is actually a large part of what this exercise is about, is learning to deal with that imperfection in a meaningful way.

Because people will genuinely get upset when they realise they haven't been actually even doing the exercise for days. They will lose hope and they will tell themselves, well, I've already missed two days worth of practicing this thing, because I didn't have the awareness to even realise I was doing this in the first place, so is there really any point going on?

And if you are well versed in the advice of NeverFap Deluxe, you'd instantly be able to recognise this as a form of rationalisation, which obviously is a huge no-no when it comes to developing our capacity for awareness.

In terms of practicing it, I wouldn't place too much emphasis on
