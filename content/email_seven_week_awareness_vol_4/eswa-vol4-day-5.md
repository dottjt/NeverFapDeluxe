## Script

Hello, and welcome to Week 4 of Volume 4 of the 7 week awareness challenge.


<!-- Shallow -->

Although this exercise is essentially a basic breathing exercise at it's core, this isn't to say that it's a shallow exercise.

Certainly I would go as far as to say that I don't believe there is such a thing as a shallow awareness exercise, in large part because the very idea of something being shallow is a personal quality that we create in our own minds.

Which is to say that nothing in life is inherently shallow. Shallow is simply a label we create in order to help us


<!-- Context -->

So what exactly is this breathing exercise about?

For starters, I believe a large part of it is about learning to remain conscious.

This exercise isn't difficult because we have a hard time controlling our breath. But it's also completely aside from the exercise itself.

What's difficult is consciously controlling our breath to a point where you feel fully conscious and connected. That's what's truly difficult, especially given the subconscious nature of breathing.

So that's what we're going to be focusing on with this exercise. 

It's truly about learning to be present with oneself, and when you're able to do this with something like your breath, it provides you with an incredible ability to simply align yourself with your own mind and essentially fully let go and simply become at one with what you are currently experiencing in that moment.

Of course, what I'm describing here is a feeling, which means there's a large amount of exploration and self-discovery involved with this exercise. 

But once you get there, my gosh. It is a very pleasant exercise.


<!-- Exercise -->

So for this exercise what we want to do is control the intonation of our breath.

By breathing in. And out. 

By breathing in. And out.

Now, using your mind, I want you to do the same time.

I want you to pretend as if your mind is breathing in. And out. 

Breathing in. And out.

And doing this kind of primer where we actually simulate what we are doing with our mind, truly is a great way to get ourselves into this exercise.


<!-- Exercise 2 -->

Now, there are many different ways we can control the intonation of our breath, and this really is where this exercise shines. Where we not only become present with our breath, but also when we control our breath, along with our ability to remain present with it.

So for example, if you breathe really quickly, you'll often notice that our ability to remain present with your breath will reflect that. You won't quite be as focused, essentially because it's more difficult to
