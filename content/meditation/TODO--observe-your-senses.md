Hello, welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Meditation series.

My name is Julius and today I will be guiding you through the wonderful world of awareness.

As always, the first step is to relax. Get yourself into a comfortable position, sitting up straight. Your posture is important, because it helps you better focus and remain in a state of being calm, although alert.

In today's session we're going to keep the focus simple. Because ultimately, that's what effective awareness is. It's keeping your mind simple and focused.

Essentially what we're going to do is pay attention to our senses.

That is, what your eyes are currently seeing. What your ears are hearing. Perhaps, there's a bird outside, chirping away or the sound of cars driving by. We're going to focus on the sensations that you may be feeling on your hands or your face.

There truly are, any number of different ways we can sense the world around us.

Certainly, with this exercise we're not attempting to create anything or feel anything in particular.

We're merely attempting to observe what we're feeling and experience.

Personally, I find it helps to refer to all of these feelings as a cloud of sensation.

Because when you think about it, we only have one consciousness to perceive all these sensations with.

And so by observing all these sensations, what we're effective observing is our own conscious awareness.

So, with this in mind... what is currently taking place within your own conscious awareness?

What are you currently feeling within the cloud of sensation that is your own conscious experience?

It could be calmness. It could be really hot or really cold where you currently are. Perhaps, it's absolutely nothing at all. That's fine too.

There really is no right or wrong way to experience reality.

There's merely our conscious awareness and what we're currently perceiving within it.

If you find yourself getting distracted and thinking about other things aside from what you're currently sensing,

It may help to just focus on a single sense. Like your hearing.

I know personally for me it helps when I focus on the cloud of sensation that is my conscious awareness.

If you think of it like a cloud, it can help you think holistically and therefore

Well, thank you for
