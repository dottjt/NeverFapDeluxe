<!-- Today's guided meditation is going to be a little bit different from others.

Instead of focusing on a particular technique, instead we're going to take a bit more of a philosophical approach.

Sometimes it can help to have a topic or theme to think about while we meditate.

And today, I want to talk about this concept of beauty. -->

In today's guided meditation, I want to talk about beauty. 

Precisely, for the next ten minutes or so, I want you to focus on feeling beautiful. 

I want you to feel beauty, and furthermore feel empowered by your beauty.

I think an interesting thing about beauty is that when you think about, beauty really is just a feeling.

On the other hand, most us have this 


 what is beauty?

Is it something you inherently have? Do you personally consider yourself to be beautiful?
