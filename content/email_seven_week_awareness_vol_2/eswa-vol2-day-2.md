Hello, and welcome to Week 2 of volume 2 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

<!-- CONTEXT - TREAT VISUAL INFORMATION AS VISUAL INFORMATION-->

This is such a fantastic awareness exercise because of how powerful it is in terms of changing how we think and feel about what it is that our eyes are actually observing.

On a fundamental level, it's important that we do engage with these kinds of visual awareness exercises, in part because on the surface, porn addiction is largely brought about by visual means. 

You know, porn is obviously this moving image that we play on a screen, and that affects our perception and in particular how feel, quite severely. Because it's so much more than an image. It's a whole world of feeling, story and narrative, which plays with our own minds and insecurities, to a point that we don't even notice we're looking at a screen.

Instead, in a lot of ways, we're actually looking at ourselves and our own emotions and feelings. When we crave porn, we're actually craving porn itself. What we're actually craving is that particular feeling which we are looking for inside of us, but cannot quite find. 

Regardless, what we're doing with this exercise is learning to conceptually dissolve the visual elements we see in front of us. 

And to break down the perceived feelings and stories and narratives that we have in our mind, back to their basic forms.

So for example, when we look at a computer desktop, we don't just see a colourful display of seemingly random pixels.

Instead, what we see are icons, and symbols and more broadly, we see structured information for us to consume and intepret.

Which is fantastic when we're using a computer to achieve something relatively productive, but really bad when we're consuming something like pornography where we take meaning and feeling and emotion from this information.

In part because we internally don't know how not to view this information for what it is fundamentally - which in this case, is the physical encasing of the computer screen, along with the LCD panel built into it. It's just not how we relate to this information, in any capacity.

Well, this exercise is here to help you do that. To treat visual information simply as nothing visual information, which is to say that what we are trying to achieve is remove the feeling, the meaning and the symbolic nature of information, so that we can have a more pure understanding of awareness.

<!-- CONTEXT -->


Why is this important? It's important because it's really hard to come to acceptance and to truly understand the nature of something, in particular what you may personally be experiencing, when you're also making interpretations based on that information.

So for example, when we look at a tree, we know that we are looking at a tree, because trees are inherently symbolic 


What we want to do instead is to merely observe the colours in front of us, without making that symbolic relationship.

we're looking at a tree, that means 


For example, 



<!-- CONTEXT -->

In this exercise we're going to be exploring this idea of colour, not just as this visual experience that makes us feel in different ways. But as a raw identity that we can relate to, no different to another person.
