## Week 3 - Dissolve Your Visual Field

Welcome to Week 3 of the 7 Week Awareness Challenge Vol 2.


## Script

Hello, and welcome to Week 3 of volume 2 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

In this exercise what we are going to do is pay attention to the judgements we personally make on a daily basis.

<!-- CONTEXT -->

For those potentially new to NeverFap Deluxe, I created these fundamental principles also known as the Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap Deluxe. And one of these principles is called Uncondition Over Judgement, and essentially what it's about is pursing acceptance over judgement.





Much like Balance over reward, this is one of those principles that people tend to ignore, because they underestimate the ramifications of ignoring it.

<u>Uncondition over judgement</u> is about pursing acceptance over judgement.

<!-- START -->

{{< hr3 "What a lot of people don't realise is that judgement is a mental trap." >}}


Because when you make a judgement, you essentially trap yourself into a limited point of view.

Of course, the reason why it may not seem like a mental trap is because at first, making one judgement isn't going to kill you.

But humans never just make one judgement.

We make thousands of judgements each and everyday, each time moulding our perception of who we are and what we know.

And when we make enough of these judgements, they can form into habits of belief which prevent us from exercising awareness.

{{< hr3 "After all, how can you be aware of what's going on in your mind, if your mind is in a constant state of habitual thinking?" >}}

The more judgements you make, the more awareness you trade, and the more faith that gets placed into ideas of who you are and what the world is.

It becomes a trap because without realising it, through judgement you end up in a state of habitual unawareness, full of harmful behaviours that we have no idea how to control or influence.

Now imagine trying to address something like porn addiction under this state of mind.

It becomes almost impossible.

Because guess what happens when you invest all your faith into a bunch of fruitless ideas?

{{< hr3 "You end up having no capacity to address the problems in your life which actually has meaning, like your porn addiction." >}}

One thing which humans are really good at is
