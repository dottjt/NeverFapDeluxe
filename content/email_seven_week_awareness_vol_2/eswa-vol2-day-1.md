## Week 1 - Take Note Of The Colour Yellow

Welcome to Week 1 of the 7 Week Awareness Challenge Vol 2.

This week we are going to be practicing an exercise called Take Note Of The Colour Yellow which is all about becoming more aware of our surroundings, and in particular being able to envision our own thoughts and ideas more clearly.

Certainly, it can help to keep in mind that this exercise is as largely conceptual as it is concrete, but it's also part of the reason why it's so comprehensively awesome. 

For further information on this practice, please visit the Take Note Of The Colour Yellow page on the website.

## Script

Hello, and welcome to Week 1 of volume 2 of the 7 week awareness challenge.

In this exercise we're going to be exploring this idea of colour, not just as this visual experience that makes us feel in different ways. But as a raw identity that we can relate to, no different to another person. 

<!-- EXERCISE - TAKE NOTE OF THE COLOUR YELLOW -->

Obviously in this particular exercise we're going to focus our attention on the colour yellow. 

Why yellow? Well, there's no particular reason why we're choosing yellow for this exercise, and that really is a key point to understand. It's not really about the colour. It's about what you do with it and how you internally relate to it.

On a fundamental level, how we will be practicing this exercise is by taking notice of the colour yellow throughout the week. It could be a particular you see. Perhaps even a detail you notice on the train, or in an app that you use on your phone. I know folder icons traditionally on Windows Desktops are yellow, so that might be something for you to take attention to.

And once you do discover something that is yellow, I simply want you to take note of it. 

And it's important for you to observe how you do that in each particular instance. Do you merely make a mental note that you've seen that colour? Is it something that you feel compelled to write down. Perhaps you just stare at it.

Regardless of what you do, it's important for you to observe those behaviours so can build that awareness moving forward, especially in regards to how you practices these exercises. Not only so you can get better at them, but in general, just so you can become more aware of who you are as a person.


<!-- CONTEXT - WHAT IS YELLOW? -->

But even before we go out in the dark, scary, brooding world and take note of the colour yellow, it's actually really important for us to actually understand what yellow is on a fundamental level. 

Because these awareness exercises are very rarely about achieving the task at hand. In fact, it's not really even about noticing colour at all. Instead, what this exercise is trying to do is become more aware of certain aspects of your mind. 

And the way we do that is by getting you to perform a task, and then have you observe that task in detail, not so you can get better at the task, but better at truly identifying yourself and how you personally respond to things like challenge and stress. 

So that's why it's really important for us to think and conceptualise before we practice these exercises, so we're truly understanding the purpose and intent of actions.

In this particular case, what this means is that we are going to spend some time actually thinking about the colour.

What it is. What it means to you. How it fits inside your conscious realm.

So what I want us to do for a moment, is to imagine the colour yellow.

And not just to imagine the colour yellow from a visual point of view, which is the point of view that more-or-less most of us can relate to. 

However to also dive into more conceptual aspects, such as what the colour yellow tastes like. 

Perhaps, what it would feel like on your skin. 


<!-- CONTEXT - BEING PRESENT WITH THE COLOUR YELLOW -->

Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, what it means to be present with this idea of the colour yellow.

Imagine if you could hold the colour within your own arms. What kind of a personality would it have? Would it be vibrant? Does your personal idea of the colour yellow even have a personality?

Most importantly, as a colour, how does it make you feel? Does the colour yellow evoke any sort of feeling? Does it even have that power, or is feeling something that we create?

These of course, are all things for you to think about while you go about your day and practice this exercise.

And I truly want you to spend a few moments of your own time, to really think about and experience these things.

Without judgement and without reservation.

So go out there. Live in the world of colour. Take note of the colour yellow, in your own personal way.

And see where that takes you, as well as how it makes you feel.
