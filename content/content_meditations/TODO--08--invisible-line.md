Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to focus on the cloud of sensation that is your own conscious experience.

So for this exercise I want you to bring yourself to a relaxed state.

Preferably sitting in a comfortable position.

And for this exercise I want you to leave your eyes open, so you can remain as aware as possible.

Essentially, what I want you to do, is to observe all things which your body is currently sensing.

In other words, I want you to observe the cloud of sensation which you are currently experiencing.

You may want to observe the light that is currently making contact with your eyes.

You may want to observe the sensations you are currently feeling on your skin.

Perhaps, you may even want to focus your attention on the temperature of your body.



There is nothing to question. Nothing to think about. All we are doing is observing what our body is currently sensing.



If you are having difficulty observing your senses, then it most likely means you are instead preoccupied with thinking.

An important thing to note about sensing, is that it's completely seperate from the process of thinking.

When you're thinking, it means you're not engaged with your senses.

Which is to say that it is incredibly difficult to both think and sense at the same time.

Our focus for this exercise is to develop our skill of observation.

Because it is a skill many of us have not spent time developing.

Especially if you are the kind of person who tends to over-think and has difficulty remaining calm and focused.

So let's focus our attention back to our senses.

Remaining calm.

Without thought.

Without expectation.

And I’ll let you do this on your own for a few minutes.


If you find your mind wandering off during this exercise, then just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

Observing what your body is feeling.





Calm.

Relaxed.

Essentially, in observation.

If you find your mind wandering off again, that’s okay. Just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

To continue to truly notice what is in front of you.

And that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been. The neverfap Deluxe Guided meditation series.


<!-- Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today I will be guiding you through the wonderful world of awareness and meditation.

If you're new to meditation, as always, the first step is to relax. To get yourself into a comfortable position, preferrably sitting if you're new to this. It's not recommended that you lie down for these exercises.

Certainly, your posture is important as well, because your posture helps you better focus and remain in a state of being calm, while also being alert. And, remaining alert is such an important part of meditation, since the goal of meditation itself is to help us develop our awareness.

And it can be incredibly difficult to develop that awareness, if you're slouched, or tense or not present with your mind.

Awareness of course is important, so that we can become more mindful of our own thoughts and behaviours. Which as a result, can afford you greater control over those aspects of your life. Which can help us deal with mental illness, as well as a variety of different things such as anxiety and depression.

In today's session we're going to keep the focus simple. Because ultimately, that's what effective awareness is about. It's about keeping your mind simple, relaxed and focused.

Essentially for this exercise, what we're going to do is pay attention to our senses.

By senses, I mean a number of things. For example, what your eyes are currently seeing.

What your ears are hearing. Perhaps, there's a bird outside, chirping away or maybe you can hear the sound of a car driving by. It could even be the temperature of the air around and how that feels on your skin.

These are all sensations that we can pay attention to and focus on. And there truly are, any number of different ways we can sense the world around us.

Certainly, with this exercise we're not attempting to create anything or necessarily even feel anything in particular.

We're merely attempting to observe what we're feeling and what we're currently experiencing from our senses.

Personally, I find it helps to refer to all of these feelings as a cloud of sensation.

Because when you think about it, we only have one consciousness to perceive all these sensations with.

And so by observing all these sensations or even one of these sensations, what we're effective observing is our own single conscious awareness.

So, with this in mind... what is currently taking place within your own conscious awareness?

What are you currently feeling within the cloud of sensation that is your own conscious experience?

It could be physical calmness. It could be, the sound of relative silence which you're observing. Perhaps it's really hot, or really cold where you currently are. What is the sensation, for example, of the clothes on your body. Maybe it's something you don't even notice. That's absolutely fine as well.

Which is to say that there really is no right or wrong way to observe your own senses.

There's merely our own conscious awareness and what we're currently perceiving within it.

So I want you to really focus on that cloud of sensation. And I'll give you some space to really explore what it is you're currently sensing.



If you find yourself getting distracted and thinking about other things aside from what you're currently sensing.

It may help to just focus on a single sense. Like your hearing.



If you're getting distracted, remember to gently think about that cloud of sensation.

What you're feeling from it.
