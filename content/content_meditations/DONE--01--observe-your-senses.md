In this guided meditation we explore observation as a concept to help us to learn to develop control over our thoughts.

<!--
Neverfap meditate

Helllo, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to keep it simple.

In part, because meditation is one of the most simple things you can do as a human being.

So for this exercise I want you to get relaxed, preferably sitting in a comfortable position. and I want you to leave your eyes open for this exercise.

Essentially, what I want you to do, without moving your eyes, or searching, is to observe what is in front of you right now.

There is nothing to question. Nothing to think about. All we are doing is observing what is in front of us.

What do you see?

You know, an interesting thing that happens when I ask that question.

What usually happens is that people will start thinking about what’s in front of them.

They’ll start trying to identify that which they are looking at.

Without realising that observation doesn’t require thought.

Your eyes are already seeing and observing.

They are already sensing your surroundings, regardless of what your mind thinks.

Which is to say that what we want to focus on is that sensing, rather than that thinking aspect we’re so used to.

So with that said, simply observe what’s in front of you.

Without thought.

Without expectation.

And I’ll let you do this for a few minutes.


If you find your mind wandering off during this exercise, then just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

Of course, you may not be used to observing.

Instead, you may be used to thinking.

They’re quite different concepts.

But that’s okay, because the skill we’re developing is an important skill.

Which will allow you to quiet your mind.

Gain control over your thoughts.

And simply exist with the present moment.

Calm.

Relaxed.

Essentially, in observation.

If you find your mind wandering off again, that’s okay. Just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

To continue to truly notice what is in front of you.

And that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been. The neverfap Deluxe Guided meditation series.

<!-- Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today I will be guiding you through the wonderful world of awareness and meditation.

If you're new to meditation, as always, the first step is to relax. To get yourself into a comfortable position, preferrably sitting if you're new to this. It's not recommended that you lie down for these exercises.

Certainly, your posture is important as well, because your posture helps you better focus and remain in a state of being calm, while also being alert. And, remaining alert is such an important part of meditation, since the goal of meditation itself is to help us develop our awareness.

And it can be incredibly difficult to develop that awareness, if you're slouched, or tense or not present with your mind.

Awareness of course is important, so that we can become more mindful of our own thoughts and behaviours. Which as a result, can afford you greater control over those aspects of your life. Which can help us deal with mental illness, as well as a variety of different things such as anxiety and depression.

In today's session we're going to keep the focus simple. Because ultimately, that's what effective awareness is about. It's about keeping your mind simple, relaxed and focused.

Essentially for this exercise, what we're going to do is pay attention to our senses.

By senses, I mean a number of things. For example, what your eyes are currently seeing.

What your ears are hearing. Perhaps, there's a bird outside, chirping away or maybe you can hear the sound of a car driving by. It could even be the temperature of the air around and how that feels on your skin.

These are all sensations that we can pay attention to and focus on. And there truly are, any number of different ways we can sense the world around us.

Certainly, with this exercise we're not attempting to create anything or necessarily even feel anything in particular.

We're merely attempting to observe what we're feeling and what we're currently experiencing from our senses.

Personally, I find it helps to refer to all of these feelings as a cloud of sensation.

Because when you think about it, we only have one consciousness to perceive all these sensations with.

And so by observing all these sensations or even one of these sensations, what we're effective observing is our own single conscious awareness.

So, with this in mind... what is currently taking place within your own conscious awareness?

What are you currently feeling within the cloud of sensation that is your own conscious experience?

It could be physical calmness. It could be, the sound of relative silence which you're observing. Perhaps it's really hot, or really cold where you currently are. What is the sensation, for example, of the clothes on your body. Maybe it's something you don't even notice. That's absolutely fine as well.

Which is to say that there really is no right or wrong way to observe your own senses.

There's merely our own conscious awareness and what we're currently perceiving within it.

So I want you to really focus on that cloud of sensation. And I'll give you some space to really explore what it is you're currently sensing.



If you find yourself getting distracted and thinking about other things aside from what you're currently sensing.

It may help to just focus on a single sense. Like your hearing.



If you're getting distracted, remember to gently think about that cloud of sensation.

What you're feeling from it.


Well, that brings us to the end of today's session. If you enjoyed this meditation, feel free to checkout the website www.neverfapdeluxe.com. We have a variety of articles, practices, even a fortnightly podcast for those who are interested. Not to mention, I also have a Patreon for those interested in supporting these meditations financially.

Regardless, I hope you have a wonderful rest of the day.

Stay safe. Stay calm and don't forget to relax.  -->






<!-- SOME LEFT OVER MATERIAL FOR CLOUD OF SENSATION -->

<!--

An interesting thing to think about, is where these sensations may be coming from.

Is there a single source where these feelings originate?

Is it possible to feel multiple senses at the same time?

Personally speaking, it helps me to visualise my own feelings as a cloud of sensation.

Which is to say that there is no seperate body or mind, so-to-speak.

Instead, there is merely a cloud of sensation from which I am experiencing myself.

Just an interesting take on this exercise,something to think about, as you practice this exercise. -->


<!--
If you are having difficulty observing your senses, then perhaps you're struggling with this concept of observation.

An important thing to note about observation, is that it's the opposite to thinking.

Because when you are thinking, it means you're not engaged with your senses.

Which in other words, is to say that it is impossible to effectively think and sense at the same time.

Of course, the purpose of this exercise is to develop our skills of observation.

Because it is a skill many of us have not spent time developing.

Especially if you are the kind of person who tends to over-think and has difficulty remaining calm and focused. -->



<!--
If you find your mind wandering off during this exercise, then just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

Observe what your body is feeling and sensing.

Observe the calmness you may be feeling.

Observe the sensations interacting with your mind.
