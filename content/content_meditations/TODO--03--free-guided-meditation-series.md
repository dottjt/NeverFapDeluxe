In this guided meditation we explore the intonation of breath as a primary topic.

<!-- senses -->

<!-- # Script

Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to be paying attention to our breath.

In particular, I want you to notice the intonation of your breath.

Notice when you breathe in.

And notice when you breathe out.

And I want you to pay attention to the rhythm that you create, as you breathe in, and out.

In.

And out.

In.

And out.

And I'll let you contiune to pay attention to this rhythm for the next while or so.


If your mind has wandered off during this exercise, then that's okay.

All we need to do is relax, and reconnect back with our breath.

Focusing on when we breathe in.

And out.

In.

And out.

Maintaining the rythm, that is our own breath.


One thing to keep in mind with these exercises, is that although something as simple as breathing may seem mindless in nature.

If you feel as if you are not truly present with your breath in this current moment.

Then you are not truly practicing this exercise as intended.

You see, this exercise doesn't have a lot to do with your breath, at all.

It has to do with your ability to remain present with your breath.

That is the skill we are developing.

First, by relaxing.

Then, by placing our attention on our breath in all aspects.

So let's focus our attention back on the intonation of our breath.

When we breathe in.

And out.

Paying close attention to the physical sensation of breathing.

And I'll let you do this within your own space.


If you find your mind wandering off again, thatâ€™s okay. Just gently remind yourself to be present with yourself.

All we are doing is remaining relaxed, as well as present with our breath.


And that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been the NeverFap Deluxe Guided meditation series. -->




<!-- NOTE: Below has not been used. -->

<!-- For today's exercise, we're going to start by closing our eyes.

 When you think about, perhaps no different to our other senses such as hearing, touch, taste, our vision is always present.

 For a good portion of the day, our eyes are constantly absorbing the visual information around us.

 Yet for better or worse, most of this information doesn't hit our conscious awareness in any meaningful way.

 So although our senses are engaged.

 With your eyes closed, I want you to relax.

 Unlike previous meditation sessions, where we have a focus in mind, for example what we're currently sensing. The idea behind this exercise is to think about nothing at all.

 What does this mean? Well, it means avoiding our senses.
