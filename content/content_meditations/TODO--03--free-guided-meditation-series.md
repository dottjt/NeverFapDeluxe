<!-- senses -->

Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to be paying attention to our breath. 

In particular, I want you to notice the intonation of your breath. 

When you breathe in.

And when you breathe out. 

And I want you to pay attention to the rhythm that you create, as you breathe in, and out. 


If your mind has wandered off during this exercise, then that's okay. All we need to do is relax, and reconnect with ourselves.


If you find yourself wandering off again, thatâ€™s okay. Just gently remind yourself to 


If you find yourself getting distracted during this exercise, that's okay. Just gently remind yourself, to 


And that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been the NeverFap Deluxe Guided meditation series.



<!-- For today's exercise, we're going to start by closing our eyes.

 When you think about, perhaps no different to our other senses such as hearing, touch, taste, our vision is always present.

 For a good portion of the day, our eyes are constantly absorbing the visual information around us.

 Yet for better or worse, most of this information doesn't hit our conscious awareness in any meaningful way.

 So although our senses are engaged.

 With your eyes closed, I want you to relax.

 Unlike previous meditation sessions, where we have a focus in mind, for example what we're currently sensing. The idea behind this exercise is to think about nothing at all.

 What does this mean? Well, it means avoiding our senses.
