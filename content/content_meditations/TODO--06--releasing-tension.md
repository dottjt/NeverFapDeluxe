Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today I will be guiding you through the wonderful world of awareness.

In today's session, I want to talk about relaxation.

Often at the beginning of these guided meditations, I will talk about putting yourself into a relaxed state before beginning the meditation.

And that whole "putting yourself into a state" is really key here to a lot of what we are trying to achieve with these meditations.

It's about putting ourselves into a state of calm and focus, so that we can concentrate on building our awareness.

Which can help us throughout the day, to function more clearly, as well as counter-balance any of the stress or perhaps negative emotion you might be feeling.
