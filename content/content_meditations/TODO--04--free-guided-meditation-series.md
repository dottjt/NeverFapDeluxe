<!-- relaxed -->

Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to be learning to let go of tension. 

Tension is something which we can experience in our body, as well as in our mind. 

And the way we are going to let go of this tension is first by fully relaxing our muscles. Beginning with the tension we feel in our arms. And it might help to picture the tension physically leaving your body. As if it's slowly leaving your body and disappearing into thin air. 

<!-- And then by focusing on our shoulders and neck. Allowing the tension to simply dissolve away. -->

And we truly want to embrace this feeling of being completely relaxed from your head, to your body, to your legs, and to your feet.

Completely letting go of the tension you consciously or subconsiously may be holding onto. 



Of course, our minds can also feel tense, especially when we are feeling stressed or anxious.

And we can learn to let go of this tension by refraining from thought, and refraining from reaction. 

And instead, by simply aimming to be present with ourselves, focusing our attention on being completely relaxed.

So you can be free of distraction. And become fully conscious with who you are in this present moment.

At it's core, this exercise is really about learning to let go.

As well as learning to become truly comfortable with this idea of letting go. 

Because only once you understand how to let go, will you be able to truly release all the tension you feel. 

Whether that be in your mind, or as a physical side-effect you experience in your body. 

And the way you do this is by actively relaxing and refraining from continuing to hold onto this tension. 

So that you can train your mind to do this without your input. 

And I'll let you continue this process within your own space, until you feel completely calm. 



If your mind has wandered off during this exercise, then that's okay. All we need to do is relax, and reconnect with yourself.

Mentally dissolving the tension that you feel in your mind, and your body. 

Ultimately, so we can be effective. 

And in-control of what we think and feel.



Stress and tension are two things which are common in many people's lives.

You may be feeling stressed as a result of having too much on your plate. Perhaps you feel unable to keep up with it all.

Perhaps you are even feeling uncertain about the future. Maybe you're feeling unsure about your career or life in general, and that's making you feel anxious or depressed.

Perhaps the tension you are feeling comes from family and friends. Maybe you are experiencing drama in your life, and things are not turning out exactly how you want it.

There are any number of ways both stress and tension can become the focus in our minds.

But by learning to let go, we can allow these aspects to no longer affect our daily lives. 

First by relaxing. 

So you can remain calm, as well as remain present with yourself in this very moment.

But also by committing yourself mentally to this exercise. 

As something important for you to do in order to learn new skills which will help you flourish and grow.




If you find yourself wandering off again, thatâ€™s okay. Just gently remind yourself to return your attention back to the present moment. 

Making yourself aware of your surroundings and purpose during this exercise.

So you can be fully present with your mind. 



If you find yourself getting distracted during this exercise, all you need to do is simply relax. 

And embrace that feelings of relaxation.


And that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been the NeverFap Deluxe Guided meditation series.

Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today I will be guiding you through the wonderful world of awareness.

Today's guided meditation is going to be a little bit different from others.

Instead of focusing on a particular technique, instead we're going to take a bit more of a philosophical approach.

Sometimes it can help to have a topic or theme to think about while we meditate.

And today, I want to talk about this concept of beauty.

Precisely, for the next ten minutes or so, I want you to focus on what beauty means to you.

For example, what does it mean to feel beautiful? Is it the same feeling as being happy?

Or, maybe you don't view beauty as a feeling. Maybe you view beauty as something more visual. Something detached from feeling.

Well, in today's session, I want you to try and feel beautiful, and to feel empowered by that feeling of beauty.

Maybe it's something you've never experienced before. That feelings of beauty.

And really, it comes down to our emotions and feelings and how we perceive them.

For example, there's this misconception that feelings are something that happen to us.

Like, when it's raining outside and we feel sad.

What we discount is the fact that we produced that emotion or feeling.

What happens is that we seem to skip ahead to the feeling or emotions, without realising that someone had to have created that emotion.

That someone, obviously being yourself.

Which is to say that you can create emotions and feelings at will, and that feeling of being beautiful is really no different.

You can simply feel beautiful, just by thinking about the feeling and what it means to you.

So that's what I want you to do, is to feel beautiful. To embrace that feeling and really try and understand what this feeling is.



Like all feelings, it really does just come down to practice.

The more you practice feeling anything, the better you will become at experiencing it and producing that feeling.
