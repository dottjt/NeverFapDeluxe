<!-- relaxed -->

Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to be learning to let go of any tension we may be feeling.

Stress and tension are two things which are common in many people's lives.

You may be feeling stressed as a result of your job. Perhaps your workload is beginning to become unmanagable, or perhaps you are in a position where you still don't quite know what it is you want to do with your career.

Or perhaps the tension you are feeling is coming from friends and family. Maybe you are currently experiencing drama in your life, and things are not turning out exactly how you want it to go.

There are any number of ways both stress and tension can become the focus in our minds.






If your mind has wandered off during this exercise, then that's okay. All we need to do is relax, and reconnect with ourselves.


If you find yourself wandering off again, thatâ€™s okay. Just gently remind yourself to


If you find yourself getting distracted during this exercise, that's okay. Just gently remind yourself, to


And that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been the NeverFap Deluxe Guided meditation series.

Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today I will be guiding you through the wonderful world of awareness.

Today's guided meditation is going to be a little bit different from others.

Instead of focusing on a particular technique, instead we're going to take a bit more of a philosophical approach.

Sometimes it can help to have a topic or theme to think about while we meditate.

And today, I want to talk about this concept of beauty.

Precisely, for the next ten minutes or so, I want you to focus on what beauty means to you.

For example, what does it mean to feel beautiful? Is it the same feeling as being happy?

Or, maybe you don't view beauty as a feeling. Maybe you view beauty as something more visual. Something detached from feeling.

Well, in today's session, I want you to try and feel beautiful, and to feel empowered by that feeling of beauty.

Maybe it's something you've never experienced before. That feelings of beauty.

And really, it comes down to our emotions and feelings and how we perceive them.

For example, there's this misconception that feelings are something that happen to us.

Like, when it's raining outside and we feel sad.

What we discount is the fact that we produced that emotion or feeling.

What happens is that we seem to skip ahead to the feeling or emotions, without realising that someone had to have created that emotion.

That someone, obviously being yourself.

Which is to say that you can create emotions and feelings at will, and that feeling of being beautiful is really no different.

You can simply feel beautiful, just by thinking about the feeling and what it means to you.

So that's what I want you to do, is to feel beautiful. To embrace that feeling and really try and understand what this feeling is.



Like all feelings, it really does just come down to practice.

The more you practice feeling anything, the better you will become at experiencing it and producing that feeling.
