In this guided meditation we explore observing the cloud of sensation that we feel within our body.


<!-- Focus on your conscious experience -->

## Script

Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to focus on what our mind is currently experiencing, right in this very moment.

So for this exercise, I want you to let go of your thoughts and worries, and feel relaxed. 

Relaxed, within your body.

Relaxed, within your own mind.

Preferably sitting in a comfortable position.

I also want you to leave your eyes open, so you can remain as aware as possible.

Essentially, what I want you to do for this exercise, is to observe what you, as an individual, is currently experiencing in this very moment.

You may want to observe the light that is currently making contact with your eyes.

You may want to observe the sensations your body is currently feeling.

You may even want to focus your attention on the intonation of your breath.

How you decide to observe your experience is entirely up to you.


There is nothing to question. Nothing to think about.

All we are doing is observing your current experience.



So what exactly does it mean to experience something?

Are you currently experiencing something right now?

Does experiencing require effort?

Are you struggling to experience life right in this very moment, or is that the experience itself? 

All things to consider about, while you practice gauging your experience. 



If you are having difficulty focusing on your experience, that's okay. 

Just gently remind yourself of what we are trying to achieve here.

Which is focus on what we are currently experiencing right now. 

Perhaps it's an emotional experience.

Perhaps, it's a thoughtless, calm experience. 

Perhaps your mind is actually racing, right now. 

If so, that's okay. 

We are not here to judge, or necessarily react to our experience. 

But instead, let's focus our attention back to our senses.

Remaining calm.

Without thought.

Without expectation.

And I’ll let you continue to do this within your own time.


If you find yourself wandering off again, that’s okay. Just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

And continue to truly notice what your body is sensing.


And that brings us to the end of today's session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been. The neverfap Deluxe Guided meditation series.


<!-- 

An interesting thing to think about, is where these sensations may be coming from.

Is there a single source where these feelings originate?

Is it possible to feel multiple senses at the same time?

Personally speaking, it helps me to visualise my own feelings as a cloud of sensation. 

Which is to say that there is no seperate body or mind, so-to-speak. 

Instead, there is merely a cloud of sensation from which I am experiencing myself.

Just an interesting take on this exercise,something to think about, as you practice this exercise. -->


<!-- 
If you are having difficulty observing your senses, then perhaps you're struggling with this concept of observation.

An important thing to note about observation, is that it's the opposite to thinking.

Because when you are thinking, it means you're not engaged with your senses.

Which in other words, is to say that it is impossible to effectively think and sense at the same time.

Of course, the purpose of this exercise is to develop our skills of observation.

Because it is a skill many of us have not spent time developing.

Especially if you are the kind of person who tends to over-think and has difficulty remaining calm and focused. -->



<!-- 
If you find your mind wandering off during this exercise, then just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

Observe what your body is feeling and sensing.

Observe the calmness you may be feeling.

Observe the sensations interacting with your mind.
