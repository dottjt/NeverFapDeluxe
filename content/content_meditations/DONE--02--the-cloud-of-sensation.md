In this guided meditation we explore observing the cloud of sensation that we feel within our body.


## Script

Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to focus on our immediate conscious experience.

Which is to say, we are going to focus on what our mind is currently experiencing, sensing and feeling, right now.

So for this exercise, I want you to let go of your mind and feel relaxed. 

Relaxed, with your body.

Preferably sitting in a comfortable position.

I also want you to leave your eyes open, so you can remain as aware as possible.

Essentially, what I want you to do for this exercise, is to observe what your body is currently sensing.

You may want to observe the light that is currently making contact with your eyes.

You may want to observe the sensations your body is currently feeling.

You may even want to focus your attention on the intonation of your breath.

How you decide to observe yourself is entirely up to you.

There is nothing to question. Nothing to think about.

All we are doing is observing what we are currently sensing.




An interesting thing to think about, is where these sensations may be coming from.

Is there a single source where these feelings originate?

Is it possible to feel multiple senses at the same time?

Personally speaking, it helps me to visualise my own feelings as a cloud of sensation. 

Which is to say that there is no seperate body or mind, so-to-speak. 

Instead, there is merely a cloud of sensation from which I am experiencing myself.

Just an interesting take on this exercise,something to think about, as you practice this exercise.


If you are having difficulty observing your senses, then perhaps you're struggling with this concept of observation.

An important thing to note about observation, is that it's the opposite to thinking.

Because when you are thinking, it means you're not engaged with your senses.

Which in other words, is to say that it is impossible to effectively think and sense at the same time.

Of course, the purpose of this exercise is to develop our skills of observation.

Because it is a skill many of us have not spent time developing.

Especially if you are the kind of person who tends to over-think and has difficulty remaining calm and focused.

So let's focus our attention back to our senses.

Remaining calm.

Without thought.

Without expectation.

And I’ll let you do this on your own for a period of time.


If you find your mind wandering off during this exercise, then just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

Observe what your body is feeling and sensing.

Observe the calmness you may be feeling.

Observe the sensations interacting with your mind.


If you find yourself wandering off again, that’s okay. Just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

And continue to truly notice what your body is sensing.


And that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been. The neverfap Deluxe Guided meditation series.
