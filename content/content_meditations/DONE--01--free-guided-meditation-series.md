<!-- relaxation -->

In this guided meditation we explore relaxation as a primary topic.

<!-- Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to focus on being relaxed. 

Not just feeling relaxed, but being relaxed on both a physical and conceptual level. 

In particular, we are going to focus on letting go of any tension that you may have in your mind.

Allowing yourself the opportunity to be completely free of thought and expectation.

As well as let go of all the tension you may have been feeling inside you.

So that you can be completely relaxed.

Completely at one with yourself and your mind.

And so that you can be truly present and aware. 

Not only with your mind.

But your body as well.


There is nothing to question. 

Nothing to think about. 

All we are doing is remaining as relaxed as our body will allow us.

And I'll let you explore this feeling of relaxation, on your own, within your own space.


If you find your mind wandering off during this exercise, that's okay.

Just gently remind yourself of what you are trying to achieve here, by letting .

To live and exist without without tension.

To let go of everything in your mind.

So we can be present with ourselv


But instead, let's focus our attention back to our senses.

Remaining calm.

Without thought.

Without expectation.

You are capable of feeling relaxed. 

You simply have to allow yourself the opportunity, to be free.


And that brings us to the end of today's session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been. The neverfap Deluxe Guided meditation series. -->
