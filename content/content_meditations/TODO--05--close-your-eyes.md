For today's exercise, we're going to start by closing our eyes.

 When you think about, perhaps no different to our other senses such as hearing, touch, taste, our vision is always present.

 For a good portion of the day, our eyes are constantly absorbing the visual information around us.

 Yet for better or worse, most of this information doesn't hit our conscious awareness in any meaningful way.

 So although our senses are engaged.

 With your eyes closed, I want you to relax.

 Unlike previous meditation sessions, where we have a focus in mind, for example what we're currently sensing. The idea behind this exercise is to think about nothing at all.

 What does this mean? Well, it means avoiding our senses.
