<!-- focus/attention/consciousness -->

Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to focus on being present with ourselves.

In particular, I want you to be present with your mind.

As if you are watching your own mind from a 3rd person perspective.

And while doing this, I want you to fully observe any and all actions your mind takes.

It could be a thought your mind produces.

It could be an emotion that you notice.

And I want you to observe your mind in this way without judgement, or reaction.

Simply, acknowledging your mind for what it is.

Regardless of what qualities it may have.

And I'll let you do this within your own space.



If you find yourself wandering off again, thatâ€™s okay. Just gently remind yourself to observe your mind.

And the thoughts and emotions it produces.

From a 3rd person perspective.

Without judgement.

And without reaction.




If you have discovered that your mind has wandered off during this exercise, then that's okay. All we need to do is relax, and reconnect with ourselves.

In this case, remaining calm and present with our thoughts and emotions.

Focusing our attention on our mind, and the world it inhabits.

And to do this, as mentioned in the beginning of this exercise, we are going to take a step back and observe our mind from a 3rd person perspective.

So we can detach from our mind.

And purely be a bystander to what our mind is doing.



If you find yourself getting distracted during this exercise, that's okay.

We are learning a new skill with this exercise, which we may not be familiar with.

Simply focus your attention back to your mind.

Without reacting to it in any way.


And that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been the NeverFap Deluxe Guided meditation series.
