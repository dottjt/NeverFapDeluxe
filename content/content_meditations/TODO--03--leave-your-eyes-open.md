Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to focus on our conscious awareness.

So for this exercise I want you to get relaxed, preferably sitting in a comfortable position. and I want you to leave your eyes open for this exercise.

Essentially, what I want you to do is to leave your eyes open and to focus your attention on your eyes. 

There’s nothing to question. Nothing to think about. 

All we are doing is focusing our attention on our eyes.

And rather than think deeply about them, instead what I want you to do is focus on the feeling of your eyes.

So with that said, simply observe what’s in front of you.

Without thought.

Without expectation.

And I’ll let you do this for a few minutes.


If you find your mind wandering off during this exercise, then just gently remind yourself to continue observing.



Calm.

Relaxed.

Essentially, in observation.




If you find your mind wandering off again, that’s okay. Just gently remind yourself to continue observing.


And that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been. The neverfap Deluxe Guided meditation series.
