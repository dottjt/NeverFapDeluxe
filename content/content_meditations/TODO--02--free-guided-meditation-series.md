Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to focus on our attention.

So for this exercise I want you to get relaxed, preferably sitting in a comfortable position. and I want you to leave your eyes open for this exercise.

Essentially, what I want you to do, is to focus on your attention.

In particular, where is your attention?

What is your attention on?

Is it on a particular thought you might be having in your mind?

Is it on a visual element within your vision.

Perhaps your attention is scattered.

All we’re doing is observing where our attention is.

And I'll let you do this for a few minutes.


If you're having difficulty keeping track of your attention, just gently remind yourself to remain focused.

Often, in the day to day of lives, we can lose track of our mind.

This is particularly true in the mornings, if we might have a particular routine that we follow.





So with that said, simply observe what’s in front of you.

Without thought.

Without expectation.

And I’ll let you do this for a few minutes.


If you find your mind wandering off during this exercise, then just gently remind yourself to continue observing.



Calm.

Relaxed.

Essentially, in observation.




If you find your mind wandering off again, that’s okay. Just gently remind yourself to continue observing.


And that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been. The neverfap Deluxe Guided meditation series. -->
