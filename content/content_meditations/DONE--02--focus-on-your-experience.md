In this guided meditation we explore this idea of experience.


<!-- Focus on your conscious experience -->
<!--
## Script

Hello, and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.

My name is Julius Reade and today we are going to focus on what our mind is currently experiencing, right in this very moment.

So for this exercise, I want you to let go of your thoughts and worries, and feel relaxed.

Relaxed, within your body.

Relaxed, within your own mind.

Preferably sitting in a comfortable position.

I also want you to leave your eyes open, so you can remain as aware as possible.

Essentially, what I want you to do for this exercise, is to observe what you, as an individual, is currently experiencing in this very moment.

You may want to observe the light that is currently making contact with your eyes.

You may want to observe the sensations your body is currently feeling.

You may even want to focus your attention on the intonation of your breath.

How you decide to observe your experience is entirely up to you.


There is nothing to question. Nothing to think about.

All we are doing is observing your current experience.



So what exactly does it mean to experience something?

Are you currently experiencing something right now?

Does experiencing require effort?

Are you struggling to experience life right in this very moment, or is that the experience itself?

All things to consider about, while you practice gauging your experience.



If you are having difficulty focusing on your experience, that's okay.

Just gently remind yourself of what we are trying to achieve here.

Which is focus on what we are currently experiencing right now.

Perhaps it's an emotional experience.

Perhaps, it's a thoughtless, calm experience.

Perhaps your mind is actually racing, right now.

If so, that's okay.

We are not here to judge, or necessarily react to our experience.

But instead, let's focus our attention back to our senses.

Remaining calm.

Without thought.

Without expectation.

And I’ll let you continue to do this within your own time.


If you find yourself wandering off again, that’s okay. Just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

And continue to truly notice what your body is sensing.


And that brings us to the end of today's session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been. The neverfap Deluxe Guided meditation series.
