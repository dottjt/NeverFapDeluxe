One important point that I would like to emphasise is that a lot of those things actually have nothing to do with porn addiction. 

For example,  you don’t necessarily require a porn addiction in order to be unmotivated. You can certain be unmotivated without a porn addiction. 

Which is also to say that a lot of the skills we will be developing have nothing to do with porn addiction at all. 

In a sense, pornography addiction has very little to do with pornography itself. 

While pornography itself is an addictive behaviour, much in the same way that alcohol, gambling and video games can be addictive, this doesn’t help explain why some of us find pornography to be so terribly destructive. 

To answer that question, we instead need to take a look at some of the beliefs that we may have developed throughout our lives, which may have influenced the way we feel about sex, women, pornography and most importantly, ourselves. 

In reality, porn addiction is a symptom of something greater. It is the result of misunderstanding on multiple levels. We are misunderstanding what women are. We are misunderstanding what happiness is. We are misunderstanding the value of time and in a lot cases, misunderstanding . 

Only by correctly these things can we 


Struggle sport

An important point I want to bring up, that I think is often misunderstood, is that if porn addiction is something that you consistently struggle with, then you’re most likely doing something wrong. 






I hope in reading this website that you discover a fundamental theme in all my posts: Overcoming porn addiction should be simple and effortless.

I didn’t up successfully give up pornography by fighting my emotions and cravings. It was only once I was able to detach myself from what I was feeling, that I was able to break through and commit to a life without porn.

Essentially, the moral of the story, is that If you’re really struggling with giving up porn, then there’s some aspect of your personality that you’re not yet familiar with. And it’s not until you fully understand who you are, that you can build up the confidence to commit to your goals. That’s what we’re here to discover.
